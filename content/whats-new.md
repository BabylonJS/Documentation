### Breaking changes

- When a seven character hex string is passed to `Color4.FromHexString`, the alpha component will default to 1 instead of defaulting all components (r, g, b, and a) to 0. ([BlakeOne](https://github.com/BlakeOne))
- [List of breaking changes introduced by our compatibility with WebGPU](https://doc.babylonjs.com/advanced_topics/webGPU/webGPUBreakingChanges)
  - [ReadPixels and ProceduralTexture.getContent are now async](https://doc.babylonjs.com/advanced_topics/webGPU/webGPUBreakingChanges#readpixels-is-now-asynchronous)
  - [Shader support differences](https://doc.babylonjs.com/advanced_topics/webGPU/webGPUBreakingChanges#shader-code-differences)
- Use both `mesh.visibility` and `material.alpha` values to compute the global alpha value used by the soft transparent shadow rendering code. Formerly was only using `mesh.visibility` ([Popov72](https://github.com/Popov72))
- Depth renderer: don't render mesh if `infiniteDistance = true` or if `material.disableDepthWrite = true` ([Popov72](https://github.com/Popov72))
- `Mesh.createInstance` no longer make a unique `Geometry` for the Mesh so updating one `Geometry` can affect more meshes than before. Use `Mesh.makeUniqueGeometry` for old behaviour. ([breakin](https://github.com/breakin))
- Ammo.js needs to be initialized before creating the plugin with `await Ammo();` since Ammo introduced an async init in their library. ([sebavan](https://github.com/sebavan))
- Recast.js needs to be initialized before creating the plugin with `await Recast();` since Recast introduced an async init in their library. ([CedricGuillemet](https://github.com/CedricGuillemet))
- Custom shaders using instancing must use `instanceColor` instead of `color` so mesh vertex colors can be used with instancing. ([CedricGuillemet](https://github.com/CedricGuillemet))
- Fixed spelling of `EventState.initialize` ([seritools](https://github.com/seritools))
- `SkeletonViewer` is now enabled by default ([Deltakosh](https://github.com/deltakosh))
- `BindEyePosition` has been moved from `Material` to `Scene` to avoid a circular dependency problem and is now a non-static method (`bindEyePosition`) ([Popov72](https://github.com/Popov72))
- The depth renderer was not generating correct values for orthographic cameras when **storeNonLinearDepth = false** ([Popov72](https://github.com/Popov72))
- `dataBuffer.ts` has been moved from `Meshes/` to `Buffers/` ([Popov72](https://github.com/Popov72))
- By default, the glTF loader now uses sRGB buffers for gamma encoded textures (when supported by the GPU), which is more accurate than using regular buffers. However, it can lead to small visual differences. You can disable usage of sRGB buffers by setting `glTFFileLoader.useSRGBBuffers` to `false` ([Popov72](https://github.com/Popov72))
- 4th (`isAnimationSheetEnabled`) and 5th (`customEffect`) parameters of `GPUParticleSystem` constructor have been inverted to match `ParticleSystem` constructor ([Popov72](https://github.com/Popov72))
- `PBRSubSurfaceConfiguration.useGltfStyleThicknessTexture` has been renamed to `PBRSubSurfaceConfiguration.useGltfStyleTextures` ([Popov72](https://github.com/Popov72))
- Properties in `IWebXRHandTrackingOptions` related to hand and joint meshes have been moved into `jointMeshes` and `handMeshes` members, respectively ([rgerd](https://github.com/rgerd))
- `IWebXRHandTrackingOptions.jointMeshes.onHandJointMeshGenerated()` provides a `hand` instead of a `controllerId` in the parameters, since the tracked joint meshes are pre-generated ([rgerd](https://github.com/rgerd))
- You should now access joint meshes from `WebXRHand` through the `getJointMesh()` function ([rgerd](https://github.com/rgerd))
- Rework of the inner working of render targets. Those are mostly internal changes. From the end user standpoint, the most visible change is that the `PostProcess` class is now dealing with `RenderTargetWrapper` instead of `InternalTexture` objects. So, if you are directly updating the `inputTexture` property with a render target texture that you previously rendered, you will need to pass a `RenderTargetWrapper` instead of an `InternalTexture`: you will get it by doing `rtt.renderTarget`, where `rtt` is the instance of your `RenderTargetTexture`. ([Popov72](https://github.com/Popov72))
- `ShaderMaterial` is now storing the effect on submeshes by default. It may be a breaking change in some special cases where one creates a `ShaderMaterial` not to be used as the material property of a mesh but instead to handle it "by hand" by calling `ShaderMaterial.isReady` / `ShaderMaterial.bind` directly. If you are doing that, you may want to pass `false` as the 5th parameter of the `ShaderMaterial` constructor to disable storing the effect on submeshes.
- The `glTFLoader.rootBabylonMesh` getter now has a nullable return type (glTF files without mesh data) ([simonihmig](https://github.com/simonihmig))
- When updating the `m` array of the `Matrix` class directly, you must call `markAsUpdated()` explicitly or the matrix changes may not take effect ([Popov72](https://github.com/Popov72), [Deltakosh](https://github.com/deltakosh), [bghgary](https://github.com/bghgary), [Sebavan](https://github.com/sebavan))
- Loading glTF assets with skins now places skinned meshes as siblings of the corresponding skeleton root nodes instead of using `skeleton.overrideMesh`. ([bghgary](https://github.com/bghgary))
- The `overrideMesh` of the `Skeleton` class has been removed. ([bghgary](https://github.com/bghgary))
- Cloning a mesh now assigns the `skeleton` property to the source skeleton. ([bghgary](https://github.com/bghgary))
- Cloning and creating instances of a mesh now refreshes the bounding box applying skins and morph targets. ([bghgary](https://github.com/bghgary))
- `KeyboardInfoPre.skipOnPointerObservable` is now correctly renamed to `KeyboardInfoPre.skipOnKeyboardObservable`. ([bghgary](https://github.com/bghgary))
- GLTF Animations are loaded at 60 FPS by default. ([carolhmj](https://github.com/carolhmj))
- `currentState` and `previousState` have been removed from use in `onInputChangedObservable` in the `DeviceSourceManager` ([PolygonalSun](https://github.com/PolygonalSun))
- `PointerInput` movement enums are no longer being used in any movement event handling in the `DeviceInputSystem` and `InputManager` ([PolygonalSun](https://github.com/PolygonalSun))
- Shadow generators now use the `Material.alphaCutOff` value instead of a hard-coded 0.4 value. ([Popov72](https://github.com/Popov72))

### Breaking changes

- `FollowCamera.target` was renamed to `FollowCamera.meshTarget` to not be in conflict with `TargetCamera.target` ([Deltakosh](https://github.com/deltakosh))
- `EffectRenderer.render` now takes a `RenderTargetTexture` or an `InternalTexture` as the output texture and only a single `EffectWrapper` for its first argument ([Popov72](https://github.com/Popov72))
- Sound's `updateOptions` takes `options.length` and `options.offset` as seconds and not milliseconds ([RaananW](https://github.com/RaananW))
- HDRCubeTexture default rotation is now similar to the industry one. You might need to Added a rotation on y of 90 degrees if you scene changes ([Sebavan](https://github.com/sebavan/))

- Optimized effect reused for shadow maps ([Deltakosh](https://github.com/deltakosh))
- Added support for scissor testing ([Deltakosh](https://github.com/deltakosh))
- Improved shader precision detection ([Deltakosh](https://github.com/deltakosh))
- Added support for bone matrix texture, allowing skeletons to use a texture instead of uniforms when possible ([Deltakosh](https://github.com/deltakosh))
- Refactored of the SolidParticleSystem code for performance and code quality improvement ([barroij](https://github.com/barroij))
- Added per solid particle culling possibility: `solidParticle.isInFrustum()` ([jerome](https://github.com/jbousquie))
- Performance-oriented changes ([barroij](https://github.com/barroij)):
  - Prevented avoidable matrix inversion or square root computation.
  - Enabled constant-time removal from the `transformNodes` array and `materials` array of the `Scene`. As a consequence, the order of the element within these arrays might change during a removal.
  - Enabled constant-time removal from the `instances` array of a `Mesh`. As a consequence, the order of the element within this array might change during a removal.
  - Stopped calling `Array.splice` on the `scene.meshes` array and on the `engine._uniformBuffer` when removing an element. As a consequence, the order of the element within these arrays might change during a removal.
  - Added an option `useGeometryUniqueIdsMap` in the `Scene` constructor options. When set to true, each `Scene` isntance will have and will keep up-to-date a map of geometry per `uniqueId`. This is to avoid browsing all the geometries of the scene when a new one is being pushed. It also enables a removal of geometry in constant time. Disabled by default.
  - Added an option `useMaterialMeshMap` in the `Scene` constructor options. When set to true, each `Material` isntance will have and will keep up-to-date a map of its bound meshes. This is to avoid browsing all the meshes of the scene to retrieve the ones bound to the current material when disposing the Material. Disabled by default.
  - Added an option `useClonedMeshhMap` in the `Scene` constructor options. When set to true, each `Mesh` will have and will keep up-to-date a map of cloned meshes. This is to avoid browsing all the meshes of the scene to retrieve the ones that have the current mesh as source mesh. Disabled by default.
  - Added `blockfreeActiveMeshesAndRenderingGroups` property in the `Scene`, following the same model as `blockMaterialDirtyMechanism`. This is to avoid calling `Scene.freeActiveMeshes` and `Scene.freeRenderingGroups` for each disposed mesh when we dispose several meshes in a row. Enable by setting `blockfreeActiveMeshesAndRenderingGroups` to `true` just before disposing the meshes, then set it back to `false` just after.
  - Prevented code from doing useless and possible time consuming computation when disposing the `ShaderMaterial` of a `LinesMesh`.
  - Make a better use of the `isIdentity` cached value within a `Matrix`.
  - Make sure we browse all the submeshes only once in `Material.markAsDirty` function.
  - Added an `Vector3.UnprojectRayToRef` static function to avoid computing and inverting the projection matrix twice when updating a Ray.
- Added per mesh culling strategy ([jerome](https://github.com/jbousquie))
