## Dev Stories

Welcome to the Dev Stories! These are project-focused narrative retellings of how
Babylon.js Team and Community members created various experiences. These stories
are specifically intended to "pave the golden path," quickly taking readers
through techniques and best practices that they can then reuse in their own
projects. In short, these stories are intended to serve as examples for readers
with a task in mind. We can't tell you _the_ way to do it, but if you want to
know how _we'd_ do it, then you've come to the right place.
