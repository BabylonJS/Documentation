Hello, my name is Nikos and I run a YouTube channel catering for programmers.

Have you ever wanted to build an awesome RTS game using Babylon.js?
Have you ever wondered how all the units in a RTS game go about their tasks?

I invite you to come and build one and learn together with me as we build a unique RTS game called Density Wars!
The game will involve you having to strategically position the units to beat your opponents. The units can link up their firepower when closer together, but you will have to balance local fire power against the overall progression of the battle.

Come and participate in this evolving RTS game series on YouTube by watching the trailer episode here:
