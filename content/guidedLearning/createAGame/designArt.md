## Summary

This is just a little bonus content if you're curious as to how I went about designing the game assets and what resources I used!

## References

Before I began any of the art asset creation, I used Pinterest to collect all of the resources I'd need. I had a bunch of different boards and made sure to save anything I thought could give me inspiration.

I made some really rough sketches of how I wanted the character and environment to look. The environment was the most vague as I wasn't sure in the beginning how I wanted the feel of the game to be. I went back in with more detail for the character reference to help with modeling.

This is also where I started thinking about what color palette I wanted to use. Similar to the pixel-art games I usually make, I wanted to use a limited color palette to keep it consistent and bring everything together. Colors aren't usually my strength, so I just try to keep a set of colors I think work well together and go from there. This is where looking for color palettes on pinterest is really helpful.

## 3D Modeling with Blender

## Character

This area was the most new to me, so I spent a lot of time learning through studying youtube tutorial and speed modeling videos. The most challening part of this would have been the character modeling + rigging process. I modeled and rigged it several times until I was satisfied with the final outcome.

The first time was to get a player model done for animation and movement testing. The main problem I had was with clipping.

- When animated, the mesh had a lot of clipping since I made the body and clothes separately. The weight painting was a difficult process to try and minimize clipping as much as possible.
- This model also uses emissive materials rather than PBR (which means it would be self-lit), so in the final version I changed these to PBR since we needed the scene to be dark and lit by the lanterns and player's light only.

The second one, I had troubles with the animations after rigging, so I decided to restart the whole process since my model must have been messed up somewhere. I referenced a ton of different rigging videos. Here are some of the videos were particularly helpful:

- [Royal Skies LLC Blender 2.8 Speed Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6vgICNCVxQ&list=PLZpDYt0cyiuu-sxJKbuYh8OjtgmXNacCV)

The third one is the one that's in the game right now! In order to fix the clipping problem I had with the other models, I joined all of the separate meshes. This made coloring the model really difficult, and I had to go back and clean up the areas where they were joined to make sure there weren't too many extra vertices. The weight painting process took a while, but at this point I was starting to get familiar with the process.

These are some of the tutorials I watched for the animation process:

- [Jayanam's Basic Running Cycle Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PkBq9NW7K8)

## Environment

Here are some of the youtubers I watched for inspiration on 3D Modeling environments!

## 2D Art

I initially started out planning on using pixel art for all of the 2D assets, but I recently got this app called Procreate, so I wanted to try and see what I could do with it.

For the pixelart ui elements in the game, I used Aseprite with my wacom intuos drawing tablet, and for all of the other 2D art I used Procreate on my ipad air.

Both of these programs are amazing and have a bunch of different features that are really helpful. Both of these support animation, but aseprite can export your animation as a spritesheet, which was really helpful when bringing into babylon. Procreate can't create spritesheets so I had to bring them into piskelapp as a gif and then export as a spritesheet.

Procreate is really awesome to use, but I found that I had a lot of limitations when making the animations since I was limited to 25 layers which means I can only have a maximum of 25 frames if all of the lineart + coloring for each frame was done on one layer. Ultimately, I could only get to a max of about 12 frames for 1 animation. I use a lot of layers to keep things separate in case I need to change or move them later, especially since I had a few different elements that were going to be animated.

Both of these are paid programs, however there are free alteratives for each that I have used before:

- Pixel art
  - [Piskelapp](https://www.piskelapp.com/)
- Digital art
  - [Autodesk Sketchbook](https://www.sketchbook.com/)
  - [Krita](https://krita.org/en/)
