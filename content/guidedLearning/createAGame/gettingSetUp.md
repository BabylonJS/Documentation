## Introduction

The game will be developed using Typescript and requires some setting up using NPM. The setup of the project will probably be the hardest part! For a simpler introduction to the features of Babylon.js and a basic HTML and JavaScript template read the [Getting Started](/features/introductionToFeatures) section first. 

The setup process for this game example is based off of the [NPM-support](/setup/frameworkPackages/npmSupport) documentation for getting started with Babylon.js and the [babylonjs webpack](https://github.com/RaananW/babylonjs-webpack-es6) sample project, but with a few additions and modifications. 

## First Steps

### Creating A Project

First you'll need to set up where you want the project to be located.

1. Using the text editor of your choice, open up your project folder. I will be using Visual Studio Code for this series.
2. Create a folder where you'll be storing your project files
3. Set up the file folder structure to be something like this:
    - dist
    - public
    - src
4. Main files
    - Go into your src folder and create an app.ts file
    - Go into your public folder and create an _index.html_ file with the following contents:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <title>Title of Your Project</title>
    </head>
    <body>
    </body>
</html>
```

Notice that we currently don't have anything within the body of our html file. We'll be generating a canvas within our app.ts file later on.

### Installing Babylon.js

1. Generate the package.json

```shell
npm init
```

You can fill these out now or just keep pressing _Enter_ and fill these out in your package.json later. 2. Open up the terminal (in VSCode you can do this by going to the top bar > Terminal > New Terminal).

3. Install Babylon.js

```shell
npm install --save-dev @babylonjs/core
npm install --save-dev @babylonjs/inspector
```

This will install all of the dependencies for babylon that you'll need.

4. Typescript Support

```shell
tsc --init
```

This will create a default tsconfig.json. You can replace the contents with:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "es6",
    "module": "ESNext",
    "moduleResolution": "node",
    "noResolve": false,
    "noImplicitAny": false,
    "sourceMap": true,
    "preserveConstEnums":true,
    "lib": [
        "dom",
        "es6"
    ],
    "rootDir": "src"
  }
}
```

### Setting Up Webpack

**Installing Dependencies**

Now that we have our package.json generated, we need to install the dev dependencies for using webpack.

```shell
npm install --save-dev typescript webpack ts-loader webpack-cli
```

**NOTE** if this line doesn't work the first time, try one more time

**Configure Webpack**

Now we will need to configure webpack to know what to do. Create a webpack.config.js file within your root directory. This is an example of what my configuration looks like:

```javascript
const path = require("path");
const fs = require("fs");
const appDirectory = fs.realpathSync(process.cwd());

module.exports = {
    entry: path.resolve(appDirectory, "src/app.ts"), //path to the main .ts file
    output: {
        filename: "js/bundleName.js", //name for the javascript file that is created/compiled in memory
    },
    resolve: {
        extensions: [".tsx", ".ts", ".js"],
    },
    module: {
        rules: [
            {
                test: /\.tsx?$/,
                use: "ts-loader",
                exclude: /node_modules/,
            },
        ],
    },
    mode: "development",
};
```

**Plugins**

Additionally, we will install some plugins that will help with updating when running locally, and cleaning our bundle.

**NOTE** Make sure that the file *webpack.config.js* is closed before installing the plugins.

```shell
npm install --save-dev html-webpack-plugin
npm install --save-dev webpack-dev-server
```

After we have these installed, we'll need to add them to our webpack.config.js. Our updated webpack.config.js should look something like this now:

```javascript
const path = require("path");
const fs = require("fs");
const HtmlWebpackPlugin = require("html-webpack-plugin");
const appDirectory = fs.realpathSync(process.cwd());

module.exports = {
    entry: path.resolve(appDirectory, "src/app.ts"), //path to the main .ts file
    output: {
        filename: "js/bundleName.js", //name for the js file that is created/compiled in memory
        clean: true,
    },
    resolve: {
        extensions: [".tsx", ".ts", ".js"],
    },
    devServer: {
        host: "0.0.0.0",
        port: 8080, //port that we're using for local host (localhost:8080)
        static: path.resolve(appDirectory, "public"), //tells webpack to serve from the public folder
        hot: true,
        devMiddleware: {
            publicPath: "/",
        }
    },
    module: {
        rules: [
            {
                test: /\.tsx?$/,
                use: "ts-loader",
                exclude: /node_modules/,
            },
        ],
    },
    plugins: [
        new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
            inject: true,
            template: path.resolve(appDirectory, "public/index.html"),
        })
    ],
    mode: "development",
};
```

Now when we build and run our project, if we make any updates, the browser will refresh so that we can see our changes. In addition, the HTML Webpack plugin is taking the javascript bundle file that is compiled and injects it into our _index.html_ file. This .js bundle will show up inside the dist folder.

### Creating A Scene

We'll be setting up the app.ts file to be the main entry point for our project.

**Set up and create the App class**

The App class will serve as our entire game application. This is a very simple example of how to set up a scene and should be separated out into different functions and make use of class variables for your project as you progress.

```typescript
class App {
    constructor() {
        // create the canvas html element and attach it to the webpage
        var canvas = document.createElement("canvas");
        canvas.style.width = "100%";
        canvas.style.height = "100%";
        canvas.id = "gameCanvas";
        document.body.appendChild(canvas);

        // initialize babylon scene and engine
        var engine = new Engine(canvas, true);
        var scene = new Scene(engine);

        var camera: ArcRotateCamera = new ArcRotateCamera("Camera", Math.PI / 2, Math.PI / 2, 2, Vector3.Zero(), scene);
        camera.attachControl(canvas, true);
        var light1: HemisphericLight = new HemisphericLight("light1", new Vector3(1, 1, 0), scene);
        var sphere: Mesh = MeshBuilder.CreateSphere("sphere", { diameter: 1 }, scene);

        // hide/show the Inspector
        window.addEventListener("keydown", (ev) => {
            // Shift+Ctrl+Alt+I
            if (ev.shiftKey && ev.ctrlKey && ev.altKey && (ev.key === "I" || ev.key === "i")) {
                if (scene.debugLayer.isVisible()) {
                    scene.debugLayer.hide();
                } else {
                    scene.debugLayer.show();
                }
            }
        });

        // run the main render loop
        engine.runRenderLoop(() => {
            scene.render();
        });
    }
}
new App();
```

At this point, you should be seeing a lot of errors. This is because we haven't imported the babylonjs dependencies. Add to the top of your file:

```typescript
import "@babylonjs/core/Debug/debugLayer";
import "@babylonjs/inspector";
import "@babylonjs/loaders/glTF";
import { Engine, Scene, ArcRotateCamera, Vector3, HemisphericLight, Mesh, MeshBuilder } from "@babylonjs/core";
```

### Bundling the Project and Running Locally

Now that we have our project set up, how do we run it locally? We need to set up tasks in our package.json. In your package.json replace your "scripts" with this:

```json
    "scripts": {
        "build": "webpack",
        "start": "webpack-dev-server --port 8080"
    },
```

Now all we need to do is:

```shell
npm run build
npm run start
```

Then when you visit localhost:8080 in our browser, you should see a sphere!

**NOTE** Additionally, you can press `SHIFT` + `CTRL` + `ALT` + `I` to show/hide the inspector.

### (Optional) Github for Version Control

If you're working with a large project, you'll most likely want to keep it in a safe place in case your computer breaks, you lose your files, etc. Github is also very useful for keeping track of changes that you make and can make things a lot easier in case you need to bring back a previous version of your project. You can follow this to learn how to [add a project](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-github-desktop) using Github Desktop.
