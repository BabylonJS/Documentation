## Introduction: Diane

As the "bridge" connecting Carlos's art to Edie's Web frontend,
Diane's first priority in architecting the 3D Vaporwear experience
was to establish the "contract" with both of her colleagues: she
worked with Carlos to figure out what features the art would provide that
her 3D experience would need to consume, and she talked to Edie about
what APIs the frontend would want to consume that her 3D experience would
need to provide. Her conversations with Carlos were described in
[a prior chapter](./art); and as for Edie, she summed up her requirements
by saying, "I'm not an expert in 3D, and I shouldn't have to be in order
to integrate your experience. I can consume any Web-like API you make, but
I don't need to know anything about how you made it."

So Diane's goal was to take the features supplied by Carlos in the art,
add interactivity, then encapsulate the entire experience into a
package that could be consumed without requiring knowledge of 3D art or
programming. To do this, she decided to build her experience using
Babylon's
[Template Repository Workflow](https://doc.babylonjs.com/toolsAndResources/templateRepositories#the-template-repository-workflow)
so that her experience would be automatically structured as an NPM
package, which in turn would make it easy for Edie to add it to her
frontend later.

## Setting Up the Repositories

Diane modeled her project development structure on that of the game
[_Fruit Fallin'_](/guidedLearning/devStories/fruitFalling),
as both projects sought to encapsulate a Babylon experience into an NPM
package for consumption in a separate "shipping vehicle."

1. Thus, she began by creating an NPM package repo and an asset host
    repo as described in the
    [first](/guidedLearning/devStories/fruitFalling#moving-playground-code-into-a-development-repo)
    and
    [second](/guidedLearning/devStories/fruitFalling#creating-an-asset-host-repo)
    sections of the _Fruit Fallin'_ Dev Story (though she didn't have a
    Playground to migrate, so her process for creating the NPM package
    repo differed from the _Fruit Fallin'_ approach similarly to how
    [the Showroom Camera repo](/guidedLearning/devStories/showroomCamera#creating-the-repository)
    had differed.)

    ![Relevant sections from another dev story](/img/devStories/vaporwearConfigurator/chapter_3d/01_fruit_fallin.png)

1. She added Carlos's art assets to her asset host repo as soon as those
    were available.

    ![Files in folder](/img/devStories/vaporwearConfigurator/chapter_3d/02_files_in_folder.png)

1. Normally at this point Diane would have tried compressing the
    file sizes of the 3D assets using dev-facing tools like
    [gltfpack](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gltfpack)
    to leverage technologies like
    [KTX2](http://github.khronos.org/KTX-Specification/#basisu_gd)
    and
    [Draco compression](https://google.github.io/draco/).
    In this particular case, however, that wouldn't have helped.
    Carlos's art was already very geometry-light (and included
    specific node structures that mesh optimization might not
    respect), making Draco compression not a major factor, and the
    heavy use of detailed normal maps in the materials would play
    to KTX2's weaknesses. She was glad she was familiar with these
    tools, but for this particular scenario she decided not to use them.
1. Diane chose to use her NPM package repo's `test_package` as
    a test environment that would later double as a demo page (similar
    to `test_package`'s use in both _Fruit Fallin'_ and Showroom Camera).
    Because the 3D Vaporwear experience was supposed to occupy the full
    Web page (with elements sometimes overlaid) in the final site, Diane
    changed her `test_package`'s index.js to more closely resemble that
    usage.

    ![Test package index.js](/img/devStories/vaporwearConfigurator/chapter_3d/03_test_package_indexjs.png)

With the repos now set up, work could begin on the real features of the
Vaporwear 3D experience.

Note: Because Dev Stories are not intended to be coding tutorials, the
following sections gloss over implementation details in order to move
at a _very_ fast pace. For specific information on how any particular
feature was done, the implementation can be inspected directly in the
code, and specific questions are always very welcome on
[the forum](https://forum.babylonjs.com/c/questions).

## Implementing the Watch

The most important part of the Vaporwear 3D experience (which was part of
an e-commerce site for selling watches) was, of course, the model of the
watch itself. Thus, the first thing Diane chose to tackle as soon as she
had the watch model was getting that imported and viewable.

1. The first step to getting the watch to display was to download it.

    ![Watch download code](/img/devStories/vaporwearConfigurator/chapter_3d/04_download_watch.png)

1. When Babylon imports a glTF that includes animations, it automatically
    starts playing the first animation it finds. Since Diane knew she
    would eventually need to use all the animations, she went ahead
    and cached references to all of them and ensured they started in
    the correct state.

    ![Cache animations](/img/devStories/vaporwearConfigurator/chapter_3d/05_cache_animation.png)

    Carlos had provided her with the names of the animations along with
    the rest of the details when he delivered the art; however, she could
    also see and test them by dragging the GLBs into Babylon's
    [3D Commerce-certified sandbox](https://3dcommerce.babylonjs.com/?assetUrl=https://syntheticmagus.github.io/vaporwear-assets/watch.glb).

1. To avoid having to worry about the camera until later, Diane just used
    an `ArcRotateCamera` to start with. With that and a few more minor
    tweaks to the scene such as setting the clear color to white, Diane
    had the most basic version of the watch rendering.

    ![The watch rendering](/img/devStories/vaporwearConfigurator/chapter_3d/06_watch_rendering.png)

1. But this _wasn't_, however, rendering using the 3D Commerce-certified
    settings. To fix this, Diane just needed to add the two code snippets
    described on the
    [Babylon docs](https://doc.babylonjs.com/divingDeeper/3D_commerce_certif#certified-viewer-version-based-on-babylonjs-engine).

    ![3D Commerce settings](/img/devStories/vaporwearConfigurator/chapter_3d/07_3d_commerce_settings.png)

1. With the watch now rendering in its default state, the next step was
    to enable other states. The Vaporwear site's design called for the
    3D experience to have five different behaviors in different parts of
    the site, so Diane formalized this notion as an enum of states, with
    the `Showroom` (the main logical container of the experience) changing
    the behavior of the watch (activating the correct animations, etc.)
    when the state changed.

    ![States enum](/img/devStories/vaporwearConfigurator/chapter_3d/08_showroom_ts_43_51.png)

1. To be able to test this behavior, Diane added a `createDebugUI`
    function to the `Showroom` that would allow the app to be controlled
    using a Babylon GUI interface.

    ![Debug UI](/img/devStories/vaporwearConfigurator/chapter_3d/09_state_control_gui.png)

1. Finally, Diane added the dynamic watch face using Babylon's GUI and
    a simple coroutine mechanism to update the text.

    ![Dynamic watch face](/img/devStories/vaporwearConfigurator/chapter_3d/10_watch_ts_136_165.png)

At this point, Diane had the watch rendering the way it should (sans
camera movement) using only what was available in the main asset file
provided by Carlos. To use the other two files -- the "studs" file and
the "materials" file -- the next step was to enable configuration.

## Enabling Configuration

The trickiest part about configuration for the Vaporwear 3D experience
was loading the assets. Carlos had warned Diane that the materials file
in particular would be large, and by 3D art standards 15 megabytes wasn't
_that_ large, but it still required some care and finesse to load such
a large asset without either causing major performance problems or
requiring a loading screen. In the end, Diane settled on a two-step trick
to load the configuration assets, after which enabling their use was
pretty straightforward.

1. The first part of Diane's loading trick was to delay loading the
    configuration assets until the experience first entered its
    "Configuration" state. Because Carlos had built the main asset
    to be self-sufficient, the experience didn't actually need the
    configuration assets until the point of configuration. However, loading
    those assets into the Babylon scene could still cause noticeable
    performance problems (mainly framerate drops or "hitches"), so Diane
    had to choose carefully when to load so that such "hitches" wouldn't
    be so noticeable. A quirk of the Vaporwear experience design was that
    in 4 out of 5 states (every state except configuration) the camera was
    always moving, so any framerate problems would be very visible.
    Consequently, Diane didn't want to do the actual loading until the
    first time in the experience that the camera held still, which would
    be as the experience was first entering the "Configuration" state in
    which the user would control the camera. Because the camera wouldn't
    be moving on its own, framerate "hitching" shouldn't be nearly as
    obvious or problematic as it would be at any other time in the
    experience. Thus, to hide the "hitches" from the loading, Diane
    introduced a mechanism that would make loading the configuration
    assets the final step of entering the "Configuration" state for the
    first time.

    ![Config asset loading logic](/img/devStories/vaporwearConfigurator/chapter_3d/11_config_assets_load.png)

1. However, the side effect of this approach was that entering the
    "Configuration" state for the first time would be slightly delayed;
    and while this was better than a visible framerate drop, Diane still
    wanted to make this delay as short as possible. This led to the second
    part of her two-step trick for loading the configuration assets:
    pre-fetching them using the JavaScript `fetch` method. This would not
    actually make the downloaded assets available to Babylon directly as
    it would not invoke any Babylon APIs. However, it would cause the
    browser to go ahead and download the files and store them in the
    cache; that way, when Babylon later made Web requests for those same
    (15 Mb, in some cases) files, such requests would be 15 Mb cache hits
    instead of 15 Mb network downloads.

    ![Assets pre-fetch trick](/img/devStories/vaporwearConfigurator/chapter_3d/12_assets_pre-fetch.png)

1. Other than loading, the only slightly complex part of enabling
    configuration was making sure the imported "studs" mesh was attached
    to the correct bone. After consulting Carlos (who had helpfully named
    the correct bone, "Bone"), Diane simply had her watch abstraction
    cache off a reference to that bone...

    ![Bone caching](/img/devStories/vaporwearConfigurator/chapter_3d/13_watch_ts_117_118.png)

    ...and provide an easy way to
    [attach the "studs" to it](https://doc.babylonjs.com/divingDeeper/mesh/bonesSkeletons#attaching-a-mesh-to-a-specific-bone).

    ![Attach studs](/img/devStories/vaporwearConfigurator/chapter_3d/14_showroom_ts_146_150.png)

1. With all the assets loaded and set up as required, enabling
    configuration was simply a matter of enabling/disabling the "studs"
    geometry...

    ![Studs enabling/disabling](/img/devStories/vaporwearConfigurator/chapter_3d/15_showroom_ts_77_79.png)

1. ...and setting named materials on named meshes, which Diane chose to
    expose as a simple helper function that wouldn't really need to be
    extended if more materials were added later.

    ![Setting materials](/img/devStories/vaporwearConfigurator/chapter_3d/16_showroom_ts_213_221.png)

1. Finally, Diane added GUI elements to the test UI to allow her to test
    the new configuration options.

    ![More GUI elements](/img/devStories/vaporwearConfigurator/chapter_3d/17_showroom_ts_276_onward.png)

## Implementing the Camera

The last feature needed to complete the Vaporwear 3D experience was the
camera. Most of the complexity of the camera's behavior was built into
the
[Showroom Camera](/guidedLearning/devStories/showroomCamera)
Babylon Utility, and the details of controlling the camera were already
built into the main asset file from Carlos. All that really remained
was to hook up the pieces, but that was still a process with a few
steps.

1. First, Diane needed to add the Showroom Camera Babylon Utility as
    an NPM dependency so that she could use it.

    ![npm install](/img/devStories/vaporwearConfigurator/chapter_3d/18_install_dependency.png)

1. She then replaced the `ArcRotateCamera` she'd been using temporarily
    with a `ShowroomCamera`. Giving that camera a single arc-rotate state
    would cause it to behave exactly like an `ArcRotateCamera`.

    ![Make showroom camera](/img/devStories/vaporwearConfigurator/chapter_3d/19_make_showroom_camera.png)

1. To get the full and correct camera behavior, however, Diane needed to
    create camera states for every different behavior. Since there were
    five different camera behaviors in the experience, she needed five
    different states: four matchmoving specific `TransformNode`s from the
    main watch asset, then one arc-rotate state using the starting
    positions from the "overall" matchmoving state.

    ![Showroom camera states](/img/devStories/vaporwearConfigurator/chapter_3d/20_showroom_camera_states.png)

    This is what Diane tried out of the box, and it immediately...didn't
    work the way she thought it would. A short amount of debugging later,
    she discovered that...

1. ...a nuance of Carlos's art assets is that they had been created in
    Blender; and while Babylon's cameras by default look in the Z-positive
    direction, Blender's by default look down Y-negative. Carlos had set
    up his camera transform nodes to work for the tool he was using, but
    when cameras were set to follow those same nodes in Babylon, the
    result was that the cameras faced the wrong direction. This, Diane
    realized, was just the sort of minor natural hiccup which always
    occurs when getting two tools to work together. While she considered
    asking Carlos to change the art to match Babylon's conventions, it
    seemed illogical for him to do something that didn't make sense in his
    own tool. Instead, Diane just modified her import logic to modify the
    camera parents slightly so that they would work with the conventions
    used by Babylon's cameras.

    ![Camera null transformation](/img/devStories/vaporwearConfigurator/chapter_3d/21_watch_ts_121_134.png)

1. With that fixed, all that was left was to set the camera to transition
    to the correct state when the Showroom changed states...

    ![Camera state transitions](/img/devStories/vaporwearConfigurator/chapter_3d/22_showroom_ts_50_73.png)

1. ...and create a mechanism for tracking and reporting the "hotspot"
    positions. For the matchmoving state "hotspots," this was simple:
    reproject the positions of the hotspot `TransformNode`s onto the
    screen and report visibility based on the animation-controlled
    "hotspot visibility" `TransformNode`'s position:

    ![Matchmove hotstpot visibility](/img/devStories/vaporwearConfigurator/chapter_3d/23_watch_ts_275_281.png)

    For the arc-rotate state "hotspot," it was slightly more tricky --
    the visibility had to be determined by a dot product thresholded
    against the "hotspot visibility" `TransformNode`'s position, as
    described in
    [the relevant section of Carlos's chapter](./art#hotspots) --
    but the math was the same.

    ![Arc-rotate hotspot visibility](/img/devStories/vaporwearConfigurator/chapter_3d/24_watch_ts_308_312.png)

    For all three "hotspots," Diane chose to expose the results simply
    as public state with an observable to inform those interested when
    the state changed.

    ![Hotspot state](/img/devStories/vaporwearConfigurator/chapter_3d/25_watch_ts_61_64.png)

And, just like that, the Vaporwear 3D experience was feature-complete.

![Watch animated transition](/img/devStories/vaporwearConfigurator/chapter_3d/26_watch_transition.png)

## Encapsulating for Frontend Consumption

At last, it was time to prepare the Vaporwear 3D experience to be handed
off to Edie for integration into the new site. For this, all Diane needed
to do was wrap the 3D experience in a Web-like API that exposed easy ways
to invoke all the features. She'd already added a vaporwearExperience.ts
file with two functions -- `CreateAsync` and `createDebugUI` -- that
she'd been invoking from the `test_package` site as shown in the
pattern from the _Fruit Fallin'_ Dev Story, so she decided to just
expand on that by adding invocation mechanisms for the rest of the
features.

1. For most features, Diane decided to just make invocation string-based
    because it was straightforward.

    ![String-based API](/img/devStories/vaporwearConfigurator/chapter_3d/27_vaporwearExperience_ts_56_74.png)

1. For the "hotspots," Diane chose to emulate the `addEventListener`
    pattern from the DOM. This required some minor adaptation of the
    way the "hotspot" state was reported internally, but not much, and it
    also afforded a convenient place to add an event notifying when
    configuration options were loaded. (Edie requested this second event
    so that she could hide the configuration options until the required
    assets were loaded.)

    ![addEventListener pattern](/img/devStories/vaporwearConfigurator/chapter_3d/28_vaporwearExperience_ts_107_123.png)

1. Camera parameter settings were actually not a part of the first
    version of the NPM package Diane delivered to Edie; instead, they
    were added later upon request because Edie wanted the zoom to be
    controlled by buttons so that the mouse wheel would remain reserved
    for scrolling the page.

    ![Camera parameters](/img/devStories/vaporwearConfigurator/chapter_3d/29_vaporwearExperience_ts_48_54.png)

1. Finally, it was time to make the Vaporwear 3D experience available for
    Edie to integrate into her frontend. Per Edie's request, Diane did this
    by publishing the experience as a
    [private NPM package](https://docs.npmjs.com/creating-and-publishing-private-packages),
    which would make it easy for Edie to take a dependency on it in her
    [React app](./frontend).

    ![npm publish](/img/devStories/vaporwearConfigurator/chapter_3d/30_npm_publish.png)

And with that, Diane's work on the Vaporwear 3D experience was complete.
She remained available to answer questions and field requests from
Edie while the latter was integrating the new experience; and, as
mentioned above, Edie did end up making a few specific requests that
Diane added in follow-up versions. The fact that the Vaporwear experience
was published as an NPM package made it easy to deal with this update
process -- publishing and updating were the same as with any other NPM
package -- and before long, Edie was able to share back to Diane and
Carlos a link showing
[the brand new Vaporwear e-commerce site](./frontend)
[running live](https://syntheticmagus.github.io/vaporwear-react-site-deployment/).
