## A note on versioning

The Babylon.js Documentation is written with the latest major version of Babylon.js in mind. [The API docs](https://doc.babylonjs.com/typedoc) are generated against the latest nightly build.

**The latest major version is v5. This is not the default version you will get from npm.**

If you want to install Babylon.js locally using the latest version, please pick the latest release [from the npm page](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@babylonjs/core), and then run:

```shellscript
 npm i @babylonjs/core@preview
```

Don't be scared about the `alpha` version. Babylon's npm releases are considered stable and are fully tested by the team.
