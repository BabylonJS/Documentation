## Customize Your Build

The Workloads that you might have known are gone in 4.0.0 in favor of [ES6 packages](/divingDeeper/developWithBjs/npmSupport#es6). You do not need anymore to customize the output of the build as you can rely on [tree shaking](https://webpack.js.org/guides/tree-shaking/) on our npm packages externally.
