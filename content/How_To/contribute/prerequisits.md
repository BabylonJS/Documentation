## Pre-Requisites

- Installation of Node.js, NPM, Git, Typescript, Gulp and have a Github Account;
- A fork and clone of Babylon.js;
- Reading the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/BabylonJS/Babylon.js/blob/master/contributing.md);
- An IDE such as VSCode;
- An ability to code in Typescript. Babylon.js is written in Typescript then compiled and distributed in JavaScript.

At the time of writing the version of Gulp needed was 4.0.0. The current [What's New](//doc.babylonjs.com/whats-new) should indicate if there have been any changes of version. You can also look in the Babylon.js repository for `package.json` in `Tools/Publisher` which will give the version number for Gulp and Typescript.
