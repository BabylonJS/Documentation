This is the quickest way to correct spelling and grammar errors or to add sentences or paragraph or two to clarify an explanation.

Requirements: you just need a [Github](https://github.com) account and a Fork of  the [Documentation](https://github.com/BabylonJS/Documentation) repository.

At the bottom of each Documentation page you will see the github icon

Select this and it will take you to the correct Github page from where you select the edit button:

You can now [use markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) to edit the documentation page.

Once done, try to quickly explain what your modification is for, and click on the _Propose file change_ button:
