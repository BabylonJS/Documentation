This tutorial will guide you through the process of creating a material for the [materials library](https://github.com/BabylonJS/Babylon.js/tree/master/packages/dev/materials)

## Setting up environment

First of all, you need to create a folder for your shader in the /materialsLibrary/src folder. Let's call it diffuseEmissive.
Then you need to create your files:

- babylon.diffuseEmissiveMaterial.ts (just copy/paste from babylon.simpleMaterial.ts)
- diffuseEmissive.vertex.fx (just copy/paste from simple.vertex.fx)
- diffuseEmissive.fragment.fx (just copy/paste from simple.fragment.fx)

Then update the config.json file in the tools/gulp and add an entry in the "materialsLibrary/libraries" section of the file:

```javascript
  "libraries": [
    ...
      {
        "output": "babylon.triPlanarMaterial.min.js",
        "entry": "./legacy/legacy-triPlanar.ts",
        "preventLoadLibrary": true
      }
      ...
  ]
```

To build all materials and generate the _dist_ folder, just run from the tools/gulp folder:

```bash
gulp materialsLibrary
```

## Update the shaders

Because we used the simple material as source, we already have everything required for a complete babylon.js material.
The simple material already supports diffuse texture.

To add support for an emissive texture, let's add this code to the header of diffuseEmissive.vertex.fx file:

```
#ifdef EMISSIVE
varying vec2 vEmissiveUV;
uniform mat4 emissiveMatrix;
uniform vec2 vEmissiveInfos;
#endif
```

Then add this code in the main function:

```
#ifdef EMISSIVE
	if (vEmissiveInfos.x == 0.)
	{
		vEmissiveUV = vec2(emissiveMatrix * vec4(uv, 1.0, 0.0));
	}
	else
	{
		vEmissiveUV = vec2(emissiveMatrix * vec4(uv2, 1.0, 0.0));
	}
#endif
```

This code will generate the correct UV to read from emissive texture. Please note that we use #ifdef to take profit of the babylon.js smart shaders.

Then you have to update the fragment shader. First add this code to the header:

```
#ifdef EMISSIVE
varying vec2 vEmissiveUV;
uniform sampler2D emissiveSampler;
uniform vec2 vEmissiveInfos;
#endif
```

Then add this code at the end of the main function (just before the last line (gl_FragColor = ...):

```
#ifdef EMISSIVE
	color.rgb += texture2D(emissiveSampler, vEmissiveUV) * vEmissiveInfos.y;
#endif
```

## Update the material

First of all, rename all occurences of _SimpleMaterialDefines_ to _DiffuseEmissiveMaterialDefines_ and _SimpleMaterial_ to _DiffuseEmissiveMaterial_.

Then add this property to _SimpleMaterialDefines_ class:

```javascript
public EMISSIVE = false;
```

Add this property to the _DiffuseEmissiveMaterial_ class:

```javascript
public emissiveTexture: BaseTexture;
```

Then go to _isReady_ function and add this code in the `if (scene.textureEnabled)` block:

```javascript
if (this.emissiveTexture && StandardMaterial.EmissiveTextureEnabled) {
  if (!this.emissiveTexture.isReady()) {
    return false;
  } else {
    needUVs = true;
    this._defines.EMISSIVE = true;
  }
}
```

The next function to update is _bind_. Add this code after the `//Textures` comment:

```javascript
if (this.emissiveTexture && StandardMaterial.EmissiveTextureEnabled) {
  this._effect.setTexture("emissiveSampler", this.emissiveTexture);

  this._effect.setFloat2(
    "vEmissiveInfos",
    this.emissiveTexture.coordinatesIndex,
    this.emissiveTexture.level
  );
  this._effect.setMatrix(
    "emissiveMatrix",
    this.emissiveTexture.getTextureMatrix()
  );
}
```

You may also need to add this code to the _clone_ function:

```javascript
if (this.emissiveTexture && this.emissiveTexture.clone) {
  newMaterial.emissiveTexture = this.emissiveTexture.clone();
}
```

For completeness, you will also have to complete the _serialize_ and _Parse_ functions (This is only required if you want to save/load your material to a .babylon file).
Please note that _serialize_ function needs to output the complete material name to the serializationObject like here:

```javascript
serializationObject.customType = "BABYLON.SimplelMaterial";
```

And you're done for the material! Now it is time to test it.

## Update the test page

To test your material, open the /materialsLibrary/index.html page. References are added automatically.

Then add the material at line 120:

```javascript
var diffuseEmissive = new BABYLON.DiffuseEmissiveMaterial(
  "diffuseEmissive",
  scene
);
diffuseEmissive.diffuseTexture = new BABYLON.Texture(
  "textures/amiga.jpg",
  scene
);
diffuseEmissive.diffuseTexture.uScale = 5;
diffuseEmissive.diffuseTexture.vScale = 5;

diffuseEmissive.emissiveTexture = new BABYLON.Texture(
  "textures/amiga.jpg",
  scene
);
diffuseEmissive.emissiveTexture.uScale = 10;
diffuseEmissive.emissiveTexture.vScale = 10;
```

Finally update the UI control:

```javascript
gui
  .add(options, "material", ["standard", "simple", "diffuseEmissive"])
  .onFinishChange(function() {
    switch (options.material) {
      case "diffuseEmissive":
        currentMaterial = diffuseEmissive;
        break;
      case "simple":
        currentMaterial = simple;
        break;
      default:
        currentMaterial = std;
        break;
    }

    currentMesh.material = currentMaterial;
  });
```

## Launch the test server

To Launch the server, you can start from the tools/gulp folder:

```bash
gulp webserver
```

## Using the material with Babylon.js file loader

Babylon.js file format supports the use of custom material. You must provide a `serialize()` and a `Parse()` functions alongside with a `getClassName()` function.
To let the loader knows about your material, you will also need to add the following line to the code using your material:

```javascript
Tools.RegisteredExternalClasses["MyMaterial"] = MyMaterial;
```

This code will add your class to the list of supported external classes so that the loader will be able to instantiate it when loading a .babylon file with a reference to your material.
