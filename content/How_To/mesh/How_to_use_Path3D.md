## How To Use Path3D

A ```Path3D``` is a mathematical object created from a sequence of position vectors of points on a curve. Once obtained a Path3D can be used to determine the triplet of vectors tangent, normal and binormal of the curve for each of those points. Each triplet can then be used as a local system coordinate. You could set, for example, the camera direction to the normal as it follows the curve.

  
A ```Path3D``` object is simple to construct as follows

```javascript
var points = [v1, v2, ..., vn];          // array of Vector3
var path3d = new BABYLON.Path3D(points);
```

You can then get the array of tangents, normals and binormals as follows

```javascript
var tangents = path3D.getTangents();
var normals = path3D.getNormals();
var binormals = path3D.getBinormals();
```

each element of the arrays is a ```Vector3``` .

Please zoom in and rotate : tangents in red, normals in blue, binormal in green.  

Notice, in the next example, how the the triplets slightly rotate when the curve goes more into depth.  
<Playground id="#2DLXYB#1" title="Tangents, Normals, and Binormals - Color Coded" description="Simple example of exploring color coded tangents, normals, and binormals."/>

Whilst at any point on the curve there is only one tangent there can be an infinite number of normals and hence binormals. If the default one does not suit you it is possible to [set the normal direction](/features/divingDeeper/mesh/path3D#set-the-normal)


## Path3D Methods

As well as ```getTangents```, ```getNormals``` and ```getBinormals``` there are some other methods of ```Path3D```.

### Get Curve Points

The ```getCurve``` method returns a copy of the initial ```Vector3``` array given to create the ```Path3D``` object. 

```javascript
var curvePoints = path3d.getCurve();
```

### Get Distances

The ```getDistances``` method returns an array of distances from one curve point to the next in order of points and with 0 being the first distance.

For the array of points [(1, 0, 0), (5, 0, 0), (5, 1, 0)] the array of distances is [0, 4, 5]. 

```javascript
var distances = path3d.getDistances();
```

### Interpolation

You can get info about any virtual point (from 0.0 to 1.0) along the path by functions that interpolate between the path points. Those are the following:

```getPointAt```, ```getTangentAt```, ```getNormalAt```, ```getBinormalAt```, ```getDistanceAt```, ```getPreviousPointIndexAt```, ```getSubPositionAt```

### Copying (part of) the path

The ```slice``` method returns a new Path3D that is subpath (slice) of the original path. It takes a _start_ and _end_ position from 0.0 to 1.0, or negative values, which wrap back around from 1.0

### Update

In order to avoid memory re-allocation (when in the render loop for example) since the given _points_ array is internally copied, you can update an existing ```Path3D``` object with its ```update()``` method.

```javascript
var points1 = [v1, v2, ..., vn];          // array of Vector3
var path3d = new BABYLON.Path3D(points1);
var points2 = [u1, u2, ..., un];          // another array of Vector3
path3D.update(points2);
```
Tangents, normals and bi-normals are thus recomputed for this new path.


### Getting the closest position to a point

The ```getClosestPositionTo``` function returns the position, from 0.0 to 1.0, of the closest virtual point along the path to an arbitrary Vector3.

## Set The Normal

For any vector there are an infinite number of vectors at right angles to it. 

![Multiple Normals](/img/how_to/Mesh/tangentnormals.jpg)

In creating a ```Path3D``` object Babylon.js assigns a default direction for the normal. If you want to set the direction of the normal yourself, you need to pass a vector for a second parameter to ```Path3D``` on creation or on update.


```javascript
var initialVector = new BABYLON.Vector3(0, 1, 0);
var otherVector = new BABYLON.Vector3(0, 0, 1);
var points = [v1, v2, ..., vn];          // array of Vector3
var path3d = new BABYLON.Path3D(points, initialVector);
// do stuff ...
path3d.update(points, otherVector);
```

The normal will be the projection of your parameter vector onto the plane orthogonal to the tangent at the point position. 

As can been in the diagram below, when the parameter is a vertical vector (black), this is projected onto the plane orthoganal to the tangent vector (red) to form the normal (green).

The playground example shows what happens as the vector setting the normal direction is rotated.

<Playground id="#8ICWNU" title="Path3D with Rotating Normals" description="Simple example of Path3D with rotating normals."/>

## Normalization and tangent alignment

Apart from the first normal, there are two more parameters:

```raw```, boolean, **false** by default. If true the tangents, normals and binormals aren't normalized. Useful to depict path acceleration or speed.

```alignTangentsWithPath```, boolean, **false** by default. If true the tangents will be aligned with the path.

## Objects Following A Path

As mentioned in the beginning section, the position of points along the curve, together with the tangent, normal, and binormal vectors, can be used to guide the position and orientation of an object, creating interesting yet effortless animations.

<Playground id="#SGVUBC#38" title="Camera Following a Path" description="Example of a Camera animated to follow the positions and orientations along a Path3D object."/>

The playground above illustrates this technique. The Path3D is constructed as the combination of a few cubic Bèzier curves (but manually defining the points would work just fine). On each point of the path, its tangent and binormal vectors are passed as [arguments](/typedoc/classes/babylon.quaternion#fromlookdirectionrh) to the ```FromLookDirectionRH()``` method of the [Quaternion class](/features/divingDeeper/mesh/transforms/center_origin/rotation_quaternions), orienting the camera such that it looks down the tangent direction, and points up towards the binormal. We then set the sequences of positions and orientations as [animation keys](/features/divingDeeper/animation/animation_design), and play it. This idea isn't limited to Cameras, as it could also be used to define paths along which characters would walk in a game, for example.
