## Ground From a Height Map

When the ground is created using _groundFromHeightMap_ the surface of the ground can be perturbed by a grayscale image file called a height map. Lighter areas are displayed higher than darker areas. This is a way of creating hills and valleys on your ground.

## MeshBuilder

Usage:

```javascript
const ground = BABYLON.MeshBuilder.CreateGroundFromHeightMap("gdhm", url_to_height_map, options, scene); //scene is optional and defaults to the current scene
```

| option       | value                                                                             | default value          |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| width        | _(number)_ size of the map width                                                  | 10                     |
| height       | _(number)_ size of the map height                                                 | 10                     |
| subdivisions | _(number)_ number of map subdivisions                                             | 1                      |
| minHeight    | _(number)_ minimum altitude                                                       | 0                      |
| maxHeight    | _(number)_ maximum altitude                                                       | 1                      |
| onReady      | _(function)_ a callback js function that is called and passed the just built mesh | (mesh) =\> \{return;\} |
| updatable    | _(boolean)_ true if the mesh is updatable                                         | false                  |

## Mesh

Usage :

```javascript
var ground = BABYLON.Mesh.CreateGroundFromHeightMap("ground", heightMapPath, width, height, subdivisions, minHeight, maxHeight, scene, updatable, onReadyCallback);
```
