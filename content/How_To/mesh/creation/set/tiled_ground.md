## Tiled Ground

A tiled ground is created differently to a ground mesh. It still lies in the xz plane. The bottom left corner of of the tiled ground is given by the values for xmin and zmin and the top right corner by xmax and zmax. The tiled ground is be subdivided into tile regions: across into w tiles and up into h tiles. In the same way every tile can be further subdivided into w by h sections. The creation of a tiled ground relies on the use of _MultiMaterials_.

## MeshBuilder

Usage:

```javascript
var tiledGround = BABYLON.MeshBuilder.CreateTiledGround("tiled ground", options, scene);
```

| option       | value                                                                                                         | default value  |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| xmin         | _(number)_ map min x coordinate value                                                                         | -1             |
| zmin         | _(number)_ map min z coordinate value                                                                         | -1             |
| xmax         | _(number)_ map max x coordinate value                                                                         | 1              |
| zmin         | _(number)_ map max z coordinate value                                                                         | 1              |
| subdivisions | _object_ _( \{w: number, h: number\} )_ number of subdivisions (tiles) on the height and the width of the map | \{w: 6, h: 6\} |
| precision    | _( \{w: number, h: number\} )_ number of subdivisions on the height and the width of each tile                | \{w: 2, h: 2\} |
| updatable    | _(boolean)_ true if the mesh is updatable                                                                     | false          |

### Steps to Create Tiling

- Create Tiled Ground
- Create materials needed for each tile
- Create multi material and push each material onto its subMaterials array
- Set the multi material as the material for the Tiled Ground
- Set the subMeshes property of the Tiled Ground to an empty array
- Create and set values for these variables

```javascript
const verticesCount = tiledGround.getTotalVertices();
const tileIndicesLength = tiledGround.getIndices().length / (subdivisions.w * subdivisions.h);
```

- Fill the subMeshes array of the Tiled Ground using

```javascript
let base = 0;
for (let row = 0; row < grid.h; row++) {
  for (let col = 0; col < grid.w; col++) {
    new BABYLON.SubMesh(row % 2 ^ col % 2, 0, verticesCount, base, tileIndicesLength, tiledGround);
    base += tileIndicesLength;
  }
}
```

## Mesh

Usage :

```javascript
const tiledGround = BABYLON.Mesh.CreateTiledGround("Tiled Ground", xmin, zmin, xmax, zmax, subdivisions, precision, scene);
const tiledGround = BABYLON.Mesh.CreateTiledGround("Tiled Ground", xmin, zmin, xmax, zmax, subdivisions, precision, scene, updatable); //one optional parameter after scene
```
