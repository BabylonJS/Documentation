## Goldberg Polyhedron

Within Babylon.js a Goldberg polyhedron (GBP) is formed as a dual of an icosahedron based geodesic polyhedron and its vertices mapped onto a sphere. The two parameters m and n used in forming the geodesic base also determine the arrangement of faces for the GBP.

![Dual](/img/snippets/geo31.png)  
Fig 1 - The red grid is the dual of the blue grid and vice-versa.

On this page we explain how to create a GBP directly. More information about [GBP Mathematics](/guidedLearning/workshop/Geodesic_Math) and the [first development stage of coding a GBP](/guidedLearning/workshop/Geodesic_Code) are available in the documentation workshop.

A GBP can only be created using `MeshBuilder`

A GBP consists of 12 pentagonal faces and a number of hexagonal faces determined by m and n. The option parameter when creating a GBP has different properties than those for `CreateGeodesic` or for `CreatePolyhedron`. However additional properties and methods, to those of a standard mesh, are available for a Goldberg mesh. These allow individual, or groups of pentagonal and hexagonal faces to be colored, textured or built upon giving a hexagon-grid planet shaped world.

The world consists of 12 poles, the pentagonal faces plus a number of hexagonal faces. Around each of the poles there is a group of hexagonal faces that are closer to one pole than the others. These are the unshared faces of the world. Depending on the value of the second parameter, **n**, there may be zero or more faces that are equidistant from two or even three poles. These are the shared faces.

![Faces](/img/snippets/geo32.png)  
Fig 2 - Poles are black, unshared faces are colored and shared faces are white.

The faces are stored in the following order

- the poles 0 to 11
- the unshared faces for pole 0, then for pole 1, pole 2 etc
- the shared faces come at the end

## MeshBuilder

usage :

```javascript
const goldbergPoly = BABYLON.MeshBuilder.CreateGoldberg("goldberg", options, scene); //scene is optional and defaults to the current scene
```

| option          | value                                                             | default value |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| m               | _(number)_ an integer > 0                                         | 1             |
| n               | _(number)_ a positive or zero integer &lt;= m                     | 0             |
| size            | _(number)_ polyhedron size                                        | 1             |
| sizeX           | _(number)_ X axis polyhedron size, overwrites the _size_ property | 1             |
| sizeY           | _(number)_ Y axis polyhedron size, overwrites the _size_ property | 1             |
| sizeZ           | _(number)_ Z axis polyhedron size, overwrites the _size_ property | 1             |
| updatable       | _(boolean)_ true if the mesh is updatable                         | false         |
| sideOrientation | _(number)_ side orientation                                       | DEFAULTSIDE   |

## Additional Properties and Methods

### Properties

Over and above the features of a standard mesh there are a number of read only features stored in the property `goldbergData` object.

Access to each follows the following example patterns

```javascript
const goldbergPoly = BABYLON.MeshBuilder.CreateGoldberg("goldberg", options);
const nbFaces = goldbergPoly.goldbergData.nbFaces;
const centerOfFace32 = goldbergPoly.goldbergData.faceCenters[32];
```

The following are all the properties of `goldbergData`

| Property        | Value                                                                |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| nbFaces         | _(number)_ Total number of faces in the GBP                          |
| nbFacesAtPole   | _(number)_ The pole plus the closest hexagons                        |
| nbUnsharedFaces | _(number)_ Total number of hexagonal faces closest to the poles      |
| nbSharedFaces   | _(number)_ Total number of faces equidistant to two poles            |
| adjacentFaces   | _(number[][])_ Array of the faces adjacent to a particular face      |
| faceCenters     | _(Vector3[])_ Array of centers of each face                          |
| faceYaxis       | _(Vector3[])_ Array of normals of each face                          |
| faceXaxis       | _(Vector3[])_ Array of vectors perpendicular to normal for each face |
| faceZaxis       | _(Vector3[])_ Array of vectors perpendicular to normal for each face |

The vector properties faceCenters[face], and faceXaxis[face], faceYaxis[face] and faceZaxis[face] can be used as a frame of reference to place meshes on the given face.

### Methods

#### Colors

Groups of faces can be colored using

```javascript
goldbergPoly.setGoldbergFaceColors(colorArray); //resets face colors whether the mesh is updatable or not
//or
goldbergPoly.updateGoldbergFaceColors(colorArray); //resets face colors only when the mesh is updatable
```

where `colorArray` is an array of elements of the form [start face, end face, Color4]

For example

```javascript
const colorArray = [
  [18, 18, new BABYLON.Color4(1, 0, 0, 1)], // color face 18 red
  [26, 37, new BABYLON.Color4(0, 1, 0, 1)], //color faces 26 to 37 inclusive green
];
```

PG: <Playground id="#A8VZGP#36" title="Adjacent Faces" description="Faces immediately adjacent"/>

PG: <Playground id="#A8VZGP#37" title="Random Adjacent Faces" description="Moving from face to adjacent face"/>

#### Textures

Groups of faces can have their texture changed by using

```javascript
goldbergPoly.setGoldbergFaceUVs(uvArray); //resets face UVs whether the mesh is updatable or not
//or
goldbergPoly.updateGoldbergFaceUVs(uvArray); //resets face UVs only when the mesh is updatable
```

where `uvArray` is an array of elements of the form [start face, end face, center, radius, angle]

center is a Vector2 with 0 &le; x, &le; 1 and 0 &le; y &le; 1 giving the relative center of a pentagon/hexagon, within a image, of given radius and set at the given angle. The image used should be square to prevent distortion of the texture.

For example

```javascript
const uvArray = [
  [18, 18, new BABYLON.Vector2(0.25, 0.75), 0.25, 0], // updates the uvs for face 18 to match the vertices of the green hexagon in Fig 3
  [26, 37, new BABYLON.Vector2(0.625, 0.37), 0.37, Math.PI / 2], //updates the uvs for faces 26 to 37 to match the vertices of the red hexagon in Fig 3
];
```

For the poles pentagons are used to match the uvs.

In the following playground the same area is applied to all the hexagonal faces and a blank area to the poles.

#### Placing Meshes

A mesh can be placed on a face using

```javascript
goldbergPoly.placeOnGoldbergFaceAt(mesh, face, position); //position is a Vector3
```

The position is relative to the center of the face and the axes, faceXaxis, faceYaxis and faceZaxis

For example
placing a box mesh on face 32

```javascript
const height = 2;
const width = 0.1;
const depth = 0.08;
const box = BABYLON.MeshBuilder.CreateBox("box", { width: width, depth: depth, height: height });
const position = new BABYLON.Vector3(0.53, height / 2, 0.34);
goldbergPoly.placeOnGoldbergFaceAt(box, 32, position);
```

Meshes should be sized accoring to the size of the face. To keep a mesh within a face values for position.x and position.z should be between around &PlusMinus;radius of face \* &radic;3

### Faces Related to a Pole

Since the faces are stored in the following order, the poles 0 to 11, the unshared faces closest to pole 0, then to pole 1, pole 2 etc and finally the shared faces, those equidistant from two or more poles, this can be used to find face numbers related to a particular pole.

For pole 0 &le; k &lt 12 you can determine the face number for the unshared faces closest to pole k using

```javascript
const faceNumb = goldbergPoly.relatedGoldBergFace(k, s); // 0 <= s < nbFacesAtPole
```

The unshared faces related to a pole are numbered in an anti-clockwise spiral around the pole.

For the shared faces you use

```javascript
const faceNumb = goldbergPoly.relatedGoldBergFace(n); //0 <= n < nbSharedFaces
```

missing out the second parameter. For n = 0 the face number returned is that of the first shared face, n = 1 that of the second shared face and so on.

## Importing An Exported Goldberg Mesh

Although a Goldberg mesh is a very specialized mesh Babylon.js supports the export and import of a Goldberg mesh using standard export and import methods.

## Example

A Goldberg mesh is exported to file.babylon.

```javascript
BABYLON.SceneLoader.ImportMeshAsync("", "PATH TO FOLDER", "file.babylon").then((result) => {
  const goldbergPoly = result.meshes[0];
});
```
