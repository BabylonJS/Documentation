This page will walk you through the 3D Commerce Viewer Certification Program, what it is, and how to get a certified viewer version based on the Babylon.js engine.

## 3D Commerce Viewer Certification Program

3D visualization technologies, initially developed for gaming and visual effects, are beginning to transform online retail experiences, advertising, and even physical retail experiences with AR/VR. 3D Commerce is a standardization working group from [**Khronos Group**](https://www.khronos.org/) aiming at removing the barriers to deploying 3D in e-commerce. 

The Viewer Certification Program enables 3D viewers across the industry to demonstrate that they can accurately and consistently display 3D products, clearing the way for reliable 3D and AR-powered shopping across multiple platforms and devices.

This program is still in its early days and as a member of this working group, the Babylon.js Team is fully engaged in helping to develop and support its adoption. More info on the [**3D Commerce Web site**](https://www.khronos.org/3dcommerce/).

## Babylon.js Sandbox - certified version

A special version of the [**Babylon.js Sandbox**](https://sandbox.babylonjs.com) has been certified because a couple parameters have to be set differently than the default engine values (which cannot be changed for backward compatibility reasons):
- Specular over alpha has to be turned off (rigth side of the picture below). It was being used to render glass before the apparition of dedicated glTF extensions such as transmission and volume.

- sRGB Buffer has to be turned on (rigth side of the picture below). It has been deactived by default for performance reasons due to browser [bug](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1256340).

## Certified viewer version based on Babylon.js engine

If you have an existing viewer (or are developing a viewer) based on Babylon.js engine, you can get a certified viewer version by:

- Setting a flag in the glTF loader for Specular over alpha:


```javascript
SceneLoader.OnPluginActivatedObservable.add((plugin) => {
    if (plugin.name === "gltf") {
        const loader = plugin as GLTFFileLoader;
        loader.transparencyAsCoverage = true;
    }
});
```

- Setting a flag at the creation of the engine for sRGB:
```javascript
const engine = new Engine(canvas, antialias, { 
    forceSRGBBufferSupportState: true
});
```

The Certification program will likely evolve with the glTF format and new extensions being taken into consideration. If some changes are not backward compatible, we'll make sure to continue documenting them on this page.
