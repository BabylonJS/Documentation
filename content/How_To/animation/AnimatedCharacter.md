This "How To" goes over an end to end workflow from creating a character in Blender, adding animations to it with [**Mixamo**](http://www.mixamo.com) and combining them into a single model, to controlling the movement of the animated character with the keyboard.

## Detailed workflow

There are of course different tools and possible workflows to create an animated model that can be used in a Babylon.js project. Below is the detailed workflow of this How To:
- Use Blender to create the model
- Export the model as .FBX
- Load the model in Mixamo to rig it and add animations
- Download animated models as .FBX files
- Use Blender to combine the animated models into one
- Export as .GLB (animation as Animation Group)
- Load the .GLB in a Babylon.js Playground and control the model movement via keyboard


## Create a character with animation

The first step is to create a character (a low poly character in this example). It usually involves starting from the 2D drawing of a character and then model it in 3D from head to toes. This is a quite long but fun experience. [**Blender**](https://www.blender.org) can be used to model a low poly character such as in Grant Abbitt's Low-Poly anime girl tutorial:

Once done with the creation of the model, the next step is to bring it to life by adding animations. The easy way to animate a character is with [**Mixamo**](https://www.mixamo.com). Grant Abbit goes over it in details in this video.

<Youtube id="k-ZeLNV4zPw"/>

 It involves going through the following:
- In Blender, export the model as an .FBX file and upload it on Mixamo
- In Mixamo, start with auto-rigging the model: after mapping key points of the model (e.g. chin, wrist, elbows etc… ), a rigging algorithm creates the skeleton onto which the animations will be applied

- Then pick an animation, "Walk" for instance,  and download the result as a .FBX file

## Add and combine several animations into a character

As several animations are needed for a character (e.g. Idle, Walk, Walk backwards, etc…), the previous step of exporting an animation into a FBX file must be done for each animation (animation packs, such as "Basic Locomotion Pack", are available but they are just a zip with many .FBX files). 

The key step to finish the character is to combine the animations, each contained in a .FBX file, into a unique model with several animations. Ben Rigby has a very simple tutorial for it here: 

<Youtube id="9EWJhqPafpk"/>

It involves importing all the FBX files into an empty Blender project making sure to rename the loaded animations,  displaying the Non-linear Animation tool, deleting the duplicate objects and adding an actions strip for each animation.  

The result is exported as a .GLB file and the animation information can be seen by drag and dropping the file in the [**Sandbox**](https://sandbox.babylonjs.com/) as Animation Groups (the .GLB file example is available [**here**](https://assets.babylonjs.com/meshes/HVGirl.glb)).

## Control the movement of the animated character with the keyboard

### Import the model and play animation

The model can be loaded using the [**ImportMesh**](/typedoc/classes/babylon.sceneloader#importmesh) method of the SceneLoader class and making sure to add the animationGroups parameter as it is used to get and play the animations.

```javascript
BABYLON.SceneLoader.ImportMesh("", "https://assets.babylonjs.com/meshes/", "HVGirl.glb", scene, function (newMeshes, particleSystems, skeletons, animationGroups) {
    var hero = newMeshes[0];

    //Scale the model down        
    hero.scaling.scaleInPlace(0.1);

    //Lock camera on the character 
    camera1.target = hero;

    //Get the Samba animation Group
    const sambaAnim = scene.getAnimationGroupByName("Samba");

    //Play the Samba animation  
    sambaAnim.start(true, 1.0, sambaAnim.from, sambaAnim.to, false);

});
```

The names of the AnimationGroups can be found in the Sandbox via the Inspector, by loading the model and selecting the Animation Group in the Scene Explorer.

![View animation info](/img/how_to/animatedCharact/viewAnim.jpg)

By default the animationGroups[0] is played when loading a model with an animation Group. To stop it: 

```javascript
animationGroups[0].stop();
```

### Control animations via keyboard

The [**Action Manager**](/divingDeeper/events/actions) can be used to capture the keys pressed on the keyboard:

```javascript
var inputMap = {};
scene.actionManager = new BABYLON.ActionManager(scene);
scene.actionManager.registerAction(new BABYLON.ExecuteCodeAction(BABYLON.ActionManager.OnKeyDownTrigger, function (evt) {
    inputMap[evt.sourceEvent.key] = evt.sourceEvent.type == "keydown";
}));
scene.actionManager.registerAction(new BABYLON.ExecuteCodeAction(BABYLON.ActionManager.OnKeyUpTrigger, function (evt) {
    inputMap[evt.sourceEvent.key] = evt.sourceEvent.type == "keydown";
}));
```

Then in the rendering loop, which is executed every frame, the position and direction of the hero character are updated:

```javascript
if (inputMap["w"]) {
    hero.moveWithCollisions(hero.forward.scaleInPlace(heroSpeed));
    keydown = true;
}
if (inputMap["s"]) {
    hero.moveWithCollisions(hero.forward.scaleInPlace(-heroSpeedBackwards));
    keydown = true;
}
if (inputMap["a"]) {
    hero.rotate(BABYLON.Vector3.Up(), -heroRotationSpeed);
    keydown = true;
}
if (inputMap["d"]) {
    hero.rotate(BABYLON.Vector3.Up(), heroRotationSpeed);
    keydown = true;
}
if (inputMap["b"]) {
    keydown = true;
}
```

And also the relevant animation are played:

```javascript
if (keydown) {
    if (!animating) {
        animating = true;
        if (inputMap["s"]) {
            //Walk backwards
            walkBackAnim.start(true, 1.0, walkBackAnim.from, walkBackAnim.to, false);
        }
        else if
            (inputMap["b"]) {
            //Samba!
            sambaAnim.start(true, 1.0, sambaAnim.from, sambaAnim.to, false);
        }
        else {
            //Walk
            walkAnim.start(true, 1.0, walkAnim.from, walkAnim.to, false);
        }
    }
}
```

This simple example can be enhanced:
- By adding a more robust logic to manage the details of selecting multiple keys and combining them
- By using the [**Device Source Manager**](/divingDeeper/input/deviceSourceManager) instead of the Action Manager for key presses
- With [**animation blending**](/divingDeeper/animation/advanced_animations#animation-blending) to ensure much more natural transitions between animations
