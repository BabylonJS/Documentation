## Sprite Map 
*Available from BJS version 4.1*

A sprite map allows you to display layers of sprites on a grid and can render thousands (dare I say millions?) of animated sprites on screen.  A large area of use, as used in this section, is in 2D and 2.5D games but other applications can also benefit. The only current limitation of this system is that the positions of the sprites are static within the grid and are dictated by the sprite map's initializing parameters. 

A  sprite map is displayed on a standard plane mesh in 3D space. and has the ability to be transformed in 3d space.  The speed of rendering is based on the the use of texture buffers and each map only requires one draw call.

Since the plane is split into a grid of tiles of the same size the cells of the packed spritesheet should be of the same size.

It uses the full JSON Array format of _TexturePacker_ and benefits from using the properties, rotation, extrude and padding.  *Soon the trim support will be functional as well*

**Note:** *SpritePackedManager* uses the JSON Hash format for packed spritesheets. JSON files are not interchangeable between *SpritePackedManager* and *SpritMap*.

The start of the JSON file format for the above packed spritesheet is shown below.

```json
{
    "frames": [
        {
	        "filename": "blank.png",
	        "frame": {"x":221,"y":221,"w":1,"h":1},
	        "rotated": false,
	        "trimmed": false,
	        "spriteSourceSize": {"x":0,"y":0,"w":32,"h":32},
	        "sourceSize": {"w":32,"h":32}
        },
        {
	        "filename": "Falling-Water-0.png",
	        "frame": {"x":1,"y":1,"w":32,"h":32},
	        "rotated": false,
	        "trimmed": false,
	        "spriteSourceSize": {"x":0,"y":0,"w":32,"h":32},
	        "sourceSize": {"w":32,"h":32}
        },
        {
	        "filename": "Falling-Water-1.png",
	        "frame": {"x":1,"y":36,"w":32,"h":32},
	        "rotated": false,
	        "trimmed": false,
	        "spriteSourceSize": {"x":0,"y":0,"w":32,"h":32},
	        "sourceSize": {"w":32,"h":32}
        },
        . . . . . . 
        . . . . . .

        {
	        "filename": "Torch-A-3.png",
	        "frame": {"x":141,"y":211,"w":32,"h":32},
	        "rotated": false,
	        "trimmed": false,
	        "spriteSourceSize": {"x":0,"y":0,"w":32,"h":32},
	        "sourceSize": {"w":32,"h":32}
        }
    ]
}
```
The complete JSON file can be found on the Github [Babylon.js repository](https://github.com/BabylonJS/Babylon.js/tree/master/packages/tools/playground/textures/spriteMap/none_trimmed/Legends_Level_A.json)

First we will start with a background that uses a 2 x 2 grid of tiles and just 4 sprites.


```javascript
let backgroundSize = new BABYLON.Vector2(2, 2); //set the size of the sprite map stage
```

Once the altlas JSON and the spritesheet texture have been loaded we can create the sprite map, setting two of the options parameter properties
```javascript
let background = new BABYLON.SpriteMap('background', atlasJSON, spriteSheet,
    {
        stageSize: backgroundSize,
        flipU: true//, //Sometimes you need to flip, depending on the sprite format.
    },
    scene
);
```

One the sprite map is created sprites are assigned to the tiles, in the grid, by their frameID, their index in the frames array. 

For simplicity and variation we choose indices 9, 18, 27 and 26 for the frameIDs
```javascript
for(let i = 0; i < 4; i++){
    background.changeTiles(0, new BABYLON.Vector2(i % 2, Math.floor(i / 2)), 9 * i + 9)
}
```
The parameters are

- _layerID_ - _(number)_ the index of sprite map layer
- _tileID_ - _(Vector2 | Vector2[])_ Vector2 identifies tile by its x position across and y position up
- _frameID_ - _(number)_ the index number in the frames array


A 2 x 2 single layer sprite map, JSON loaded from file: <Playground id="#YCY2IL#14" title="Single Layer Sprite Map From A File" description="Simple example of a 2x2 single layer sprite map loaded from a .json file."/>

Once created you can export the sprite map to save it and then load it into another sprite sheet of the same structure.

## Saving a Sprite Map
After you have created a sprite map you can export this composition for later use, with

```javascript
mySpriteMap.saveTileMaps()
```
creating a *.tilemaps* file.

When importing it you must make sure that the sprite map you are importing it into has the same tile layout and number of layers as the one it was exported from.  You import it with

```javascript
spriteMap.loadTileMaps(url); //url is the location of the .tilemaps file
```
