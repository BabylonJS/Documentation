# Node Material

The Node Material is a simple, highly customizable material that you can build yourself piece by piece. Combined with the powerful node-based editor, you can easily create stunning custom GPU shaders and FX for your Babylon.js scenes.

The Node Material allows you to avoid writing complicated shader language code, instead replacing it with simple processes of either using UI (the Node Material Editor) or by creating and connecting node blocks in your scene code (the Node Material blocks).

## Creating a Node Material using code

### Initial steps

If you are interested in learning how to create node materials through code, you might consider starting with the video below as it goes over 3 important tips to help you get started:

<Youtube id="GrmVObi6caQ"/>

To start using the Node Material, you just need to instantiating one:

```
var nodeMaterial = new BABYLON.NodeMaterial("node material", scene, { emitComments: true });
```

Please note that the third parameter will contain optional values that will let you configure how the material will build its shader:

-   `emitComments`: Set this value to true if you want the blocks to emit comments in the shader code

### Adding blocks

Blocks can be added by just instantiating them:

```
var morphTargets = new BABYLON.MorphTargetsBlock("morphTargets");
```

For input blocks, you can then define either their value or the source of the value:

```
var timeInput = new BABYLON.InputBlock("time");
timeInput.value = 0;
```

or

```
var viewProjectionInput = new BABYLON.InputBlock("viewProjection");
viewProjectionInput.setAsSystemValue(BABYLON.NodeMaterialSystemValues.ViewProjection);
```

System values can be:

-   BABYLON.NodeMaterialSystemValues.World
-   BABYLON.NodeMaterialSystemValues.View
-   BABYLON.NodeMaterialSystemValues.WorldView
-   BABYLON.NodeMaterialSystemValues.Projection
-   BABYLON.NodeMaterialSystemValues.ViewProjection
-   BABYLON.NodeMaterialSystemValues.WorldViewProjection
-   BABYLON.NodeMaterialSystemValues.CameraPosition
-   BABYLON.NodeMaterialSystemValues.FogColor
-   BABYLON.NodeMaterialSystemValues.DeltaTime

Input blocks can also take their value from a mesh attribute:

```
let positionInput = new BABYLON.InputBlock("position");
positionInput.setAsAttribute("position");
```

Attributes can be:

-   position
-   normal
-   tangent
-   uv
-   uv2
-   matricesIndices
-   matricesWeights
-   matricesIndicesExtra
-   matricesWeightsExtra

When you manually set the value of an InputNode, you can flag it as `node.isConstant` to indicate that the value will not be dynamically updated and thus the node material will be able to optimize the block by not generating an uniform for this value.

The following functions will let you get information about your InputNode:

-   `isSystemValue`
-   `isAttribute`
-   `isUniform`
-   `isConstant`

When an InputNode is an uniform (eg. a manual value that will be sent to the shader) and not a constant, you can set `inputNode.visibleInInspector` to true so users will be able to visually control the value of the node using Babylon.js Inspector.

You can even csutomize the look and feel of the Inspector UI by defining `inputNode.min` and `inputNode.max` to get a slider instead of an input text box.

### Connecting blocks

By default calling `block.connectTo(otherBlock)` will try to establish a connection by picking an output from the first block and connect it to an available input in the second one:

```
var positionInput = new BABYLON.InputBlock("position");
positionInput.setAsAttribute("position");

var worldInput = new BABYLON.InputBlock("world");
worldInput.setAsSystemValue(BABYLON.NodeMaterialSystemValues.World);

var worldPos = new BABYLON.TransformBlock("worldPos");
positionInput.connectTo(worldPos);
worldInput.connectTo(worldPos);
```

If you do not want to use the automatic connection you can then pick the output and the input you want to connect directly:

```
worldInput.output.connectTo(boneBlock.world);
```

You can check if two connection points can connect with

```
if (worldInput.output.canConnectTo(boneBlock.world)) {
    ...
}
```

The system will throw an exception if you try to connect two incompatible connection points.

When connected, two connection points can be disconnected with:

```
worldInput.output.disconnectFrom(boneBlock.world);
```

### Gettings blocks

Once a graph is built inside a NodeMaterial, you can use the following API to get a specific node by name:

```
let block = nodeMaterial.getBlockByName("MyBlock");
```

You can also get a block using a predicate:

```
let block = nodeMaterial.getBlockByPredicate((b) => b.getClassName() === "AddBlock" && b.name === "foo");
```

Or you can also use this API to get an InputNode and use it to setup its value if the node is set manual value:

```
let block = nodeMaterial.getInputBlockByPredicate((b) => b.name === "foo");
block.value = 10;
```

Note that while this API generically works for all input blocks, not all input blocks have a "value" attribute. For example texture blocks would have block.texture instead of block.value. Be sure to check the [API documentation](/typedoc/classes/babylon.nodematerial) for detail.

You can access the list of InputBlocks with:

```
nodeMaterial.getInputBlocks();
```

Or you can get all blocks registered with a node material with:

```
nodeMaterial.attachedBlocks
```

Be sure to also check out the full [API documentation.](/typedoc/classes/babylon.nodematerial)

            -   ambientClr: Color3
            -   diffuseDir: Color3
            -   specularDir: Color3
            -   clearcoatDir: Color3
            -   sheenDir: Color3
            -   diffuseInd: Color3
            -   specularInd: Color3

            -   refraction: Color3
            -   lighting: Color3
            -   shadow: Float
            -   alpha: Float

        Notes:

        -   The `Dir` suffix in the name of the outputs means `Direct` and are components from direct lighting (spot, point light, directional, ...).
        -   The `Ind` suffix in the name of the outputs means `Indirect` and are components from indirect lighting (IBL, ...).
        -   The `lighting` output is the combination (sum) of all the other outputs (except for `shadow` and `alpha`) and is the one to use if you want to deal with the final output color. This color **is in gamma space**.
        -   All the `XXXClr`, `XXXDir` and `XXXInd` outputs are individual lighting components and can be used if you need to perform further processing with them. These components are **in linear space**.
        -   The `shadow` output is the shadow component when this material is used for shadow rendering (0 means completely in shadow from all lights and 1 means fully visible by all lights). You can use it for additional special effects (see <Playground id="#Y642I8" title="Tinted Shadows Example" description="A Playground example of tinted shadows."/> ) for tinted shadows for eg - it's for the standard material but it would work the same for PBR too) but note that you don't need to do anything with it by default to have shadows rendered correctly for your material

### Building the Node Material

Once setup, you can ask the Node Material to build its internal shaders (vertex and fragment) by calling `nodeMaterial.build(true)`. You can set the boolean parameter to true to get a log of the final shaders on the console.

The build function will throw an exception if the shaders cannot be compiled:

```
try {
    nodeMaterial.build(true);
} catch (err) {
    console.log("Unable to compile because " + err);
}

```

Once successfully built, you can use the Node Material like any other materials:

```
myMesh.material = nodeMaterial;
```

### Example

Here is one of the simplest code using the Node Material:

```
var nodeMaterial = new BABYLON.NodeMaterial("node material", scene, { emitComments: true });
var positionInput = new BABYLON.InputBlock("position");
positionInput.setAsAttribute("position");

var worldInput = new BABYLON.InputBlock("world");
worldInput.setAsSystemValue(BABYLON.NodeMaterialSystemValues.World);

var worldPos = new BABYLON.TransformBlock("worldPos");
positionInput.connectTo(worldPos);
worldInput.connectTo(worldPos);

var viewProjectionInput = new BABYLON.InputBlock("viewProjection");
viewProjectionInput.setAsSystemValue(BABYLON.NodeMaterialSystemValues.ViewProjection);

var worldPosdMultipliedByViewProjection = new BABYLON.TransformBlock("worldPos * viewProjectionTransform");
worldPos.connectTo(worldPosdMultipliedByViewProjection);
viewProjectionInput.connectTo(worldPosdMultipliedByViewProjection);

var vertexOutput = new BABYLON.VertexOutputBlock("vertexOutput");
worldPosdMultipliedByViewProjection.connectTo(vertexOutput);

// Pixel
var pixelColor = new BABYLON.InputBlock("color");
pixelColor.value = new BABYLON.Color4(0.8, 0.8, 0.8, 1);

var fragmentOutput = new BABYLON.FragmentOutputBlock("fragmentOutput");
pixelColor.connectTo(fragmentOutput);

// Add to nodes
nodeMaterial.addOutputNode(vertexOutput);
nodeMaterial.addOutputNode(fragmentOutput);
```

Please note that this code is equivalent to:

```
var nodeMaterial = new BABYLON.NodeMaterial("node material", scene, { emitComments: true });
nodeMaterial.setToDefault();
```

## Using the Node Material Editor

The Node Material Editor can be used to visually edit / build your Node Material.

![NME](/img/how_to/Materials/nme.jpg)

To invoke the editor you can call `nodematerial.edit()` but this code must be called inside a user interaction (like a click event). You can also call it through the Inspector:

```
scene.debugLayer.show();
scene.debugLayer.select(nodeMaterial);
```

When selected in the Inspector, you can find an edit button in the Node Material property pane.

You can also use a standalone version of the editor here: <nme id="" title="Node Material Editor" description="The starting basic template for creating Node Materials." image="/img/playgroundsAndNMEs/nodeMaterial.jpg"/>

### Custom Frames

<Youtube id="_bxAQM0pnzs"/>

<Youtube id="9wL777qGpiI"/>

![NME](/img/how_to/Materials/custom_frames_1.jpg)

When using the node material editor we can create frames by holding shift and dragging the mouse across nodes within the graph.

A frame is an easy way to group several nodes together and collapse them into a smaller group to declutter the graph and allow you to reuse certain node branches. We can rename the frame, change its color, and even make a note/comment about it.

When we collapse the node, input and output ports that are linked to other nodes outside of the grame, will be exposed on the frame edges. (You can manually set a port to be exposed as well). Here we can edit the exposed ports by renaming them or even changing the order.

![NME](/img/how_to/Materials/custom_frames_2.jpg)

We can export a frame by using the “Export” button.

Once exported, we can load it back into our project for future use by clicking the “+” symbol on the “Custom Frames” tab of the node menu, in the left panel. 

![NME](/img/how_to/Materials/custom_frames_3.jpg)

By loading a custom frame, we can reuse it quickly just like any other node block. Custom frames will stay in this menu any time you open the node material editor. 

![NME](/img/how_to/Materials/custom_frames_4.jpg)

We also have a library of custom frames available for you to leverage here: https://github.com/BabylonJS/Assets/tree/master/nme/customFrames

### Recreating the StandardMaterial

As a training exercise and to show what is possible to do with the Node Material Editor, the `StandardMaterial` has been recreated in the NME:

-   <nme id="#AT7YY5#6" title="Full Standard Material NME" description="A Node Material Editor setup of the full standard material." image="/img/playgroundsAndNMEs/NMEfullStandardMaterial.jpg"/>
-   <nme id="#AT7YY5#7" title="Standard Material Without Alpha NME" description="A Node Material Editor setup of the standard material without alpha support." image="/img/playgroundsAndNMEs/NMEstandardMaterialNoAlpha.jpg"/>
-   <Playground id="#M5VQE9#19" title="Playground of Standard Material and NME Standard Material" description="Playground to compare the existing `StandardMaterial` and the corresponding Node Material." image="/img/playgroundsAndNMEs/PGstandardMaterialNMEstandardMaterial.jpg"/>

Note that the only difference between the full material and the material without alpha support is that nothing is wire to the `fragmentOutput.a` input. If you don't need alpha support, you should use the "non alpha" node material as alpha-based materials have some constraints:

-   they don't write to the zbuffer and are only sorted among themselves, so some sorting rendering artifacts can arise
-   they need the `transparencyShadow` property to be `true` for shadow rendering

Let's see how the material has been created and how to use it.

### Main building frames

The material is divided into several frames, mirroring the main features of the standard material:

-   Instances
-   Morphs and bones
-   Ambient
-   Diffuse
-   Specular
-   Reflection
-   Emissive
-   Bump (normal map)
-   Opacity
-   Lightmap
-   Vertex color
-   Fog

In each of these frames, you generally find a boolean float node that enable/disable the feature, and possibly some other properties to fine-tune the feature. Most of these properties are **Constant** properties, meaning they won't consume a _uniform_ in the shaders and won't be visible in the Inspector / be updatable in javascript: you must change their value directly in the material (they correspond to the `#define` you can find in the standard material shader code).

Note that you won't find this enable/disable property in the **Instances**, **Morphs and bones** and **Fog** frames: they are always enabled. That's because they depend on the mesh geometry / settings (or on a scene setting for **Fog**): those frames will be a simple "pass-through" if the corresponding feature doesn't exist on the mesh / scene, so no need to explicitly disable it in that case.

### Additional building frames

There are a number of additional frames that help organizing the graph more cleanly:

-   Final normal. This frame takes the output from the **Bump** frame and builds the final world normal used in subsequent computations (**Reflection** and **Lights**). You can change the `TWOSIDEDLIGHTING` boolean if you want the lighting to be applied whatever the triangle side facing are.
-   Final diffuse computation. It is the frame responsible for computing the final diffuse component, taking into account the ambient, emissive and vertex color components. Here you can modify the `LINKEMISSIVEWITHDIFFUSE` and `EMISSIVEASILLUMINATION` booleans to change the way the diffuse value is computed.
-   Final color computation. Everything is brought together to compute the final rgb color: ambient (texture), specular, reflection and emissive.
-   Final alpha computation. After the opacity (alpha) is generated from the **Opacity** frame, a number of additional computation is performed to produce the final alpha value. You can step in this computation by mean of two booleans, `REFLECTIONOVERALPHA` and `SPECULAROVERALPHA`.
-   Premultiply alpha to color. This one does what its title says and is enabled by the `PREMULTIPLYALPHA` boolean.

### Construction notes

The material itself is not so complicated as each feature is generally restricted to its own frame and has few connections with other frames. That helps to keep each building block manageable and easily understandable.

Below are a few things of note.

### Working without a `if` statement

As you may know, there's no `if` statement / block in the node material editor, so one must be creative to overcome this. Luckily, the standard material does not use this statement heavily (as it's better to avoid it for performance sake), so it is easy enough to deal with it. Most of the time, it is something like `if boolean is true, use this value in subsequent computation, else use that other value instead`. A **Lerp** block is the tool to use:

```c
Lerp(a, b, gradient)
```

`gradient` is the boolean: if it is 0, `a` is the output, if it is 1, `b` is the output. Then use the output in subsequent computation.

Example:

![Emissive](/img/how_to/Materials/nme_lerp.png)

If `EMISSIVE` is set to 0, the output is `vEmissiveColor`, else it is the color from the emissive map. In effect, the `EMISSIVE` boolean lets you choose to use either the constant `vEmissiveColor` color or the color from the texture map as the emissive color.

### Discarding the fragment based on alpha cutoff value

This construct is meant to discard the fragment if alpha testing is enabled and if the alpha value is below some threshold value (cutoff value). It looks like this:

![Discard](/img/how_to/Materials/nme_discard.png)

As you can see, the `alphaCutOff` node is not directly connected to the `cutoff` input of **Discard** (the **Discard** block will discard the fragment if the `value` input is lower than the `cutoff` input). That's because we need to let the user enable or disable this feature.

What it does instead is comparing the alpha value from the diffuse texture to `ALPHATEST - 1 + alphaCutOff`, `ALPHATEST` being the boolean value that lets the user enable (1) or disable (0) the feature.

If `ALPHATEST = 1`, the computed value is `alphaCutOff`, which is the expected input for `Discard.cutoff` in that case (alpha testing is enabled).

If `ALPHATEST = 0`, the computed value is `-1 + alphaCutOff`. As `alphaCutOff` is a value between 0 and 1, `-1 + alphaCutOff` will always be lower or equal to 0. So, `Discard.cutoff` <= 0 in that case, meaning the fragment will never be discarded (which is the expected result when alpha testing is disabled).

You could also have used `Lerp(0, alphaCutOff, ALPHATEST)` as the input for `Discard.cutoff`, but it's likely that the addition + subtraction used above is faster than a `Lerp` on GPUs (would need some benchmarking to be sure), even if it's by a small (negligible) margin.

## Creating PBR materials

You can use those playgrounds and materials as starting points for your own experiments to create PBR materials in the NME (note that the node material may take some time to load in the PG - the mesh will stay black until the material is loaded):

-   Full use of all PBR blocks:
-   PG: <Playground id="#D8AK3Z#16" title="PBR Blocks Playground" description="Playground of the full use of PBR blocks in NME." image="/img/playgroundsAndNMEs/PGPBRNME.jpg"/>
-   Material: <nme id="#EPY8BV#6" title="PBR Blocks NME" description="Node Material Editor of the full use of PBR blocks." image="/img/playgroundsAndNMEs/NMEPBRNME.jpg"/>
-   PBR material with sheen only:
    -   PG: <Playground id="#MUX769#4" title="PBR Blocks Sheen Only Playground" description="Playground of PBR blocks in NME using sheen only." image="/img/playgroundsAndNMEs/PGPBRSheenNME.jpg"/>
    -   Material: <nme id="#V3R0KJ" title="PBR Blocks Sheen Only NME" description="Node Material Editor of PBR blocks using sheen only." image="/img/playgroundsAndNMEs/NMEPBRSheenNME.jpg"/>
-   PBR material with clear coat only:
    -   PG: <Playground id="#0XSPF6#6" title="PBR Blocks Clear Coat Only NME" description="Playground of PBR blocks in NME using clear coat only." image="/img/playgroundsAndNMEs/PGPBRclearCoatNME.jpg"/>
    -   Material: <nme id="#C3NEY1#4" title="PBR Blocks Sheen Only NME" description="Node Material Editor of PBR blocks using clear coat only." image="/img/playgroundsAndNMEs/NMEPBRclearCoatNME.jpg"/>
-   PBR material with sub surface only:
    -   PG: <Playground id="#7QAN2T#8" title="PBR Blocks sub surface Only Playground" description="Playground of PBR blocks in NME using sub surface only." image="/img/playgroundsAndNMEs/PGPBRsubSurfaceNME.jpg"/>
    -   Material: <nme id="#100NDL#1" title="PBR Blocks sub surface Only NME" description="Node Material Editor of PBR blocks using sub surface only." image="/img/playgroundsAndNMEs/NMEPBRsubSurfaceNME.jpg"/>

The inputs of the different PBR blocks are using the same names as in the `PBRMetallicRoughnessMaterial` class, so you can refer to [this doc](/typedoc/classes/babylon.pbrmetallicroughnessmaterial) for explanations about them.

Some of the parameters are available as properties when clicking on the block in the NME.

For eg, for `Reflection`:

![Reflection properties](/img/how_to/Materials/nme_reflection_prop.png)

Or for `PBRMetallicRoughness`:

![PBR properties](/img/how_to/Materials/nme_pbr_prop.png)

As for the standard `PBRMaterial`, if no texture is provided for the **Reflection** / **Refraction** texture, the one declared at the scene level (`scene.environmentTexture`) is used instead.

By default, if something is connected to the `a` input of the `FragmentOutput` block, alpha blending is enabled. If you don't need alpha blending, don't connect this input.

Regarding the `PBRMetallicRoughness` block, you have access to each output component separately (`ambient`, `diffuse`, `specular`, ...) if you want or you can directly use `lighting` to get the composite output. In the names of the separate outputs, `dir` means `direct` (component from direct lights) and `Ind` means `Indirect` (component from indirect lighting, meaning the environment).

## Creating Post Processes

Starting with Babylon.js v4.2, you can now create post processes with the node material editor.

You need simply to change the mode to _Post Process_:

![PostProcess choice](/img/how_to/Materials/postprocessMenu.png)

In this mode, the special block **CurrentScreen** corresponds to the frame buffer that will be passed to your post process when you use this material as a post process in a real scenario. You can load any texture you want, it's simply an helper for you to see how your post process will render in the end.

Some blocks are made unavailable in this mode (they are hidden from the block list), as they have no meaning: the mesh, particle and animation blocks.

When you have created your post process material in the NME, you can create a regular `BABYLON.PostProcess` instance by calling the `NodeMaterial.createPostProcess` method:

```javascript
const postProcess = nodeMaterial.createPostProcess(camera);
```

You can also update an existing post process:

```javascript
const myPostProcess = new BABYLON.PostProcess(...);
...
nodeMaterial.createEffectForPostProcess(myPostProcess);
```

PG: <Playground id="#WB27SW#1" title="NME Post Process Playground Example" description="Playground example of using the Node Material Editor to create a Post Process effect." image="/img/playgroundsAndNMEs/PGNMEPostProcess.jpg"/>

As for regular node materials, you can access the blocks programmatically and change their values:

Base material: <Playground id="#WB27SW#4" title="NME Post Process Base Node Material" description="Playground example of a NME Post Process Base Material." image="/img/playgroundsAndNMEs/PGNMEPostProcessBaseMaterial.jpg"/>

Programmatically updated material: <Playground id="#WB27SW#3" title="NME Post Process Base Material Modification" description="Playground example of modifying a base Post Process material programmatically." image="/img/playgroundsAndNMEs/PGNMEPostProcessBaseMaterialModification.jpg"/>

## Creating Procedural textures

Starting with Babylon.js v4.2, you can now create procedural textures with the node material editor.

You need simply to change the mode to _Procedural texture_ this time:

Some blocks are made unavailable in this mode (they are hidden from the block list), as they have no meaning: the mesh, particle and animation blocks.

When you have created your procedural texture in the NME, you can create a regular `BABYLON.ProceduralTexture` instance by calling the `NodeMaterial.createProceduralTexture` method:

```javascript
const proceduralTexture = nodeMaterial.createProceduralTexture(256);
```

As always, you can also load the NodeMaterial from our snippet server:

```
var ground = BABYLON.MeshBuilder.CreateGround("ground", {width: 6, height: 6}, scene);

BABYLON.NodeMaterial.ParseFromSnippetAsync("#A7A3UB#1", scene).then((nodeMaterial) => {
    const proceduralTexture = nodeMaterial.createProceduralTexture(256);

    let mat = new BABYLON.StandardMaterial();

    mat.emissiveTexture = proceduralTexture;

    ground.material = mat;
});
```

Starting with Babylon.js v4.2, you can now create particle shaders (to be used with a particle system) with the node material editor.

You need simply to change the mode to _Particle_:

![Particle choice](/img/how_to/Materials/particleMenu.png)

Some blocks are made unavailable in this mode (they are hidden from the block list), as they have no meaning: the mesh, post process and animation blocks.

Also, in this mode, you can't create a vertex shader, only a fragment shader: the vertex shader is fixed and not updatable.

Note that everything is driven by the parameters of the particle system instance. For eg, if the current particle system displayed in the preview area does not use "ramp gradients", the `ParticleRampGradient` block does nothing (it does not add ramp gradients to the shader), it's just a pass-through. Same thing for the `ParticleBlendMultiply` block. The exception is the `ParticleTexture` block, and only in the preview area of the node editor: if you provide a texture for this block it will be used as the particle texture in the preview area, else the texture defined in the current particle system will be used. In any case, when using the material in a live program, the texture will always be the one defined by the `ParticleSystem.particleTexture` property.

The materials you create in the **Particle** mode can also be used for GPU particle systems, save for these restrictions:

-   GPU particle systems don't support ramp gradients, so the `RampGradientBlock` won't do anything (you can still use it in your material, it will simply do nothing)
-   GPU particle systems don't support the `textureMask` property, so you should not use the `ParticleTextureMask` block in your materials targeted for GPU particle systems, else display artifacts will appear

When you have created your particle shader in the NME, you can link the material to a particle system instance by calling the `NodeMaterial.createEffectForParticles` method:

```javascript
nodeMaterial.createEffectForParticles(particleSystem);
```

The full fragment shader used by default by the particle system can be recreated in the NME: <nme id="#X3PJMQ#1" title="NME Full Default Fragment Shader" description="Node Material Editor setup of the default fragment shader for particle systems." image="/img/playgroundsAndNMEs/NMEdefaultParticleFragmentShader.jpg"/>

As explained above, if you want to use this material for GPU particle systems, you should remove the use of the `ParticleTextureMask` block: <nme id="#X3PJMQ#2" title="NME Full Default Fragment Shader GPU Version" description="Node Material Editor setup of the default fragment shader for particle systems on the GPU." image="/img/playgroundsAndNMEs/NMEdefaultParticleFragmentShaderGPU.jpg"/>

## Loading from a file saved from the Node Material Editor

You can directly setup a Node Material from a file saved from the Node Material Editor.

Here is the code to use:

```
nodeMaterial.loadAsync("file-url.json").then(() => {
    nodeMaterial.build(true);
});
```

## Sharing unique URLs

When using the <nme id="" title="Node Material Editor" description="The starting basic template for creating Node Materials." image="/img/playgroundsAndNMEs/nodeMaterial.jpg"/>, you can have an additional option to save your work using a unique URL (like the Playground for instance). You can then share these urls (which are immutable).

Example: <nme id="#2F999G" title="Node Material Editor Unique URL Example" description="Example Node Material Editor saved with a unique URL." image="/img/playgroundsAndNMEs/NMEsnippetServerSaveExample.jpg"/>

## Loading from a snippet (unique URL)

You can use the following code to load a saved node material from a unique URL:

```
BABYLON.NodeMaterial.ParseFromSnippetAsync("2F999G", scene).then(nodeMaterial => {
    sphere.material = nodeMaterial;
});
```

When using NME within the Playground, you have the opportunity to edit your material with the Inspector and let the Playground update your snipped id automatically (each time NME will save a new snippet id it will inform the playground to also change the id in your code.

And to begin with you can simply call this code to start a new Node Material from scratch:

```
BABYLON.NodeMaterial.ParseFromSnippetAsync("_BLANK", scene).then(nodeMaterial => {
    sphere.material = nodeMaterial;
});
```

Note:

-   There is a use case where you may want to load a node material, but ignore any embedded or linked textures stored in the json. This could be where you are going to supply new textures in code and you don't want to incur the cost of loading the old textures or if you are reusing a node material from an old project where only the textures need to be updated. To do this, place this static property in your code before creating or loading your node materials:

```
BABYLON.NodeMaterial.IgnoreTexturesAtLoadTime = true;
```

And then from there you could have used the Inspector to edit it (The inspector can replace the \_\_BLANK with the right id later on).

## Node material examples

Here are some node material examples that you can use "as is" or extend with the NME:
