The Raw Texture feature is incredibly simple, but unbelievably powerful! It allows you to create a texture from raw data! This type of thing is perfect for creating procedural textures on the fly. Let's take a look at how to create a simple RBG texture from scratch.

Creating a Raw RBG Texture can be done using the following construction method:

```javascript
new BABYLON.RawTexture.CreateRGBTexture(data, width, height, scene);
```

data: This is the raw data that you'll use for the rbg values of each pixel of your texture. The data needs to be an 8-bit array...specifically a javascript 'uint8array.'

width: The desired width of the texture you'd like to create.

height: The desired height of the texture you'd like to create.

scene: Your Babylon scene.

Here's a small demo of it working. Check out line 29 in this playground: <Playground id="#3TM0BZ" title="Raw Texture Noise Terrain Example" description="Simple example of using noise data to generate an rgb texture, used as a height map to displace a mesh for a terrain effect." image="/img/playgroundsAndNMEs/divingDeeperRawTexture1.jpg"/>

In this case, random noise is being generated, converted into a Uint8Array and that is then used to create a Raw RGB Texture.

Here is a video explanation, diving a little futher into how this demo uses the raw texture.

## Diving Deeper

Of course, creating an RBG texture on the fly is only the tip of the iceberg. There's a LOT more you can do with Raw Texture, such as creating RGBA, Luminance, Alpha, and Luminance Alpha textures.
