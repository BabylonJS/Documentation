## Adding Project To Workspace

By default, a newly created workspace contains one project. Per workspace, it is possible to manage multiple
projects in order to, for example, split levels of a game.

A newly created project is always empty and ready to receive new assets etc.

## Creating A New Project
To create a new project in the workspace, just go to the `File` menu in the toolbar and select `Add New Project...`.

Once clicked, a popin appears to ask for the name of the project. Once the button `Finish` is clicked,
the new project is being created on the file system. Then, the Editor will ask to load continue working
on the current project or load the new one.
