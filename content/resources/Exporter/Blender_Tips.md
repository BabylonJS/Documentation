Since Babylon and Blender often do things differently, it can sometimes be a pain working with both of them together. Here's a few tips that will smooth things out a bit.

## Geometry

### Smooth shading

If you export the default Blender scene to BJS, you'll shortly see that your cube doesn't look like exactly as it should:

This is because a 3D modeler viewport don't act like a 3D realtime engine. By default, Blender always create object using flat shading mode.
If you want to see your scene smoothed as in BJS, you have to select all your objects and click to _Shading_ > _Smooth_ in 3D View Toolshelf.

Now, you're cube looks ugly. You have to set up its sharpness, by adding an _edge split_ modifier, and play with edge angle and sharp edges. Job done!

## Cameras

### ArcRotate

When choosing arc rotate camera type, you have to add a target to your camera.

To do that:

- first select your camera, then its target (object or empty for example),
- press `Ctrl` + `T` > `Track To Constraint`.

## Workflow

### Quickly Export

If you go to _File_ > _export_ and right click on babylon, you can select _Create Shortcut_, and make a easy to use shortcut to export to babylon! For example, you can use _Ctrl-E_.

## Animation

### Commons

#### One file per animated object

Usually, you will have one master scene containing all statics elements, and a blend file for each animated elements.

To easily see your animated element inside the master scene, open your master scene and go to File > Link, then go inside the blend containing the animated element, and import your objects. It can be more simple to link groups instead of objects, to update links in an easier way.

#### Rotation mode

By default, Blender use the `XYZ Euler` rotation mode, which is fine for most of cases, but you have to know that `Quaternion` (which avoid gimbal lock issue) is also supported.

- `XYZ Euler` will be stored in the [mesh.rotation](/typedoc/classes/babylon.mesh#rotation) property
- `Quaternion` will be stored in the [mesh.rotationQuaternion](/typedoc/classes/babylon.mesh#rotationquaternion) property

For armatures, it does not matter because the animation is kind of baked during export.

### Armatures

#### Maximum ## of influencers fix

If you ever get the error `WARNING: Maximum ## of influencers exceeded for a vertex, extras ignored`, never fear!

In weight painting mode, click _weights_ and then _limit total_. This will automatically limit the mesh's vertices to 4 influences.
