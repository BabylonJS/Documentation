# Using External Assets in the Playground

Sometimes you might want to load you own assets into the playground. Should the reason for doing so be to get help with a feature please think carefully before doing so.

It is very likely that the issue you are struggling with can be isolated and presented in a simplified and more focused form using basic meshes and existing [textures](/toolsAndResources/assetLibraries/availableTextures) and [models](/toolsAndResources/assetLibraries/availableMeshes).

Doing this will lead to quicker answers as your question will be more understandable, since few people want to work through long sections of code.  Using the existing assets will also ensure that they remain reachable and the playgrounds you create will still be a useful resource in the future.  However should you still wish to use your own assets then this page describes ways of doing so.

 Any site hosting you assets must be [CORS compliant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing) and use the secure [https](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS) protocol.

## From github.com

### using raw.githubusercontent.com

 - ensure that your git repo is set to **public**
 - navigate to your file. We'll take as example https://github.com/BabylonJS/MeshesLibrary/blob/master/PBR_Spheres.glb
 - remove `/blob/` part
 - replace `https://github.com` by `https://raw.githubusercontent.com`
 - you now have raw access to your file `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BabylonJS/MeshesLibrary/master/PBR_Spheres.glb`

```javascript
BABYLON.SceneLoader.ImportMesh("", "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BabylonJS/MeshesLibrary/master/", "PBR_Spheres.glb", scene);
```

 <Playground id="#YIU90M" title="Using Assets From Github" description="Simple example of loading assets from github into the playground."/>

### using rawgit.com
 
You were able to use [GitHub](https://github.com/) with a link generated by the **[RawGit](https://rawgit.com/)** site to ensure correct MIME type. Unfortunately this site has now closed.

Any existing links to files using **RawGit** can be updated using **[Raw Git to jsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/rawgit)**. Changes should be made to **RawGit** links before October 2019.

### using jsdelivr.com

 To use **[jsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com)** with a file: 
 - ensure that your git repo is set to **public**
 - let's say you have a file named _myFile.babylon_ on  **github**, go to that file in your repository and click on the commit number. 
 - then in the address bar copy the part after `https://github.com/`, for example

 ```javascript
myGithubUserName/myRepository/commit/2bd79648e08709145cd9575e6679b2ea360f12f6
 ```

 - replace `/commit/` with `@`

 ```javascript
myGithubUserName/myRepository@2bd79648e08709145cd9575e6679b2ea360f12f6
 ```

 - add at the front `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/`

 ```javascript
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myGithubUserName/myRepository@2bd79648e08709145cd9575e6679b2ea360f12f6
 ```

- *(optionnal)* by adding the filename to the end, you now have direct download access

 ```javascript
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myGithubUserName/myRepository@2bd79648e08709145cd9575e6679b2ea360f12f6/myFile.babylon
 ```

You now have all necessary data to load your meshes.
 
```javascript
BABYLON.SceneLoader.ImportMesh("", "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myGithubUserName/myRepository@2bd79648e08709145cd9575e6679b2ea360f12f6", "myFile.babylon", scene);
```

From our MeshesLibrary repo, [using PBR_Spheres.glb](https://github.com/BabylonJS/MeshesLibrary/commit/fa494961cbe0b8d44854b3cf8aa8268ba211741a):

## From Gitlab.com

### using GitLab pages

You have to configure your own [Gitlab pages](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/pages/).

When done, just use the direct link in the loader:

```javascript
BABYLON.SceneLoader.ImportMesh("", "https://yourpages.gitlab.io/yourScene/", "myFile.babylon", scene);
```

## From dropbox.com

[Dropbox](https://dropbox.com) could be use both for playground debugging and easily sharing assets.

- upload your file
- click on `Share` button
- generate a public download link, here our example: `https://www.dropbox.com/s/rANdoMGeneR4tedLink/my-file.glb?dl=0`
- replace `www` in url by `dl`, also remove `?dl=0` at the end
- you now have a direct access url: `https://dl.dropbox.com/s/rANdoMGeneR4tedLink/my-file.glb`

It can be used in this way:

```javascript
BABYLON.SceneLoader.ImportMesh("", "https://dl.dropbox.com/s/rANdoMGeneR4tedLink/", "my-file.glb", scene);
```

 <Playground id="#8LFTCH#14" title="Loading Assets From Dropbox" description="Simple example of loading assets from dropbox."/>

## From imgur.com

[Imgur](https://imgur.com) could be useful to quickly use custom textures.

- upload your image, here our example: https://imgur.com/a/KhuCTFr
- copy the direct link, here https://imgur.com/yn98ktz
- do a `right-click > View image` or add `i.` in front of `imgur.com` and image extension to the end of url, here https://i.imgur.com/yn98ktz.png
- use this direct access url in your playground

```javascript
var texture = new BABYLON.Texture("https://i.imgur.com/yn98ktz.png", scene);
```

 <Playground id="#UNEWTE" title="Loading Assets From Imgur" description="Simple example of loading assets from imgur."/>

## Embedded assets 

You can make a raw text copy-paste of your assets, like the content of a .gltf file.

Note that you need to use `Append` so you can define the plugin to use as there is no more file extension.

```javascript
    var mymodel = {
        [...]
    };

    var json = JSON.stringify(mymodel);
    var blob = new Blob([json]);
    var url = URL.createObjectURL(blob);

    BABYLON.SceneLoader.Append(url, "", scene, function(scene) {
        scene.createDefaultCameraOrLight(true, true, true),
        scene.createDefaultEnvironment();
    }, null, null, ".gltf");
```

 <Playground id="#KEY4S4" title="Loading Embedded Assest" description="Simple example showing how to load embedded assets."/>

## Javascript files

For Javascript files you need to wait for the file to be loaded before attempting to access it.

```javascript
var url = "LINK ADDRESS";
var s = document.createElement("script");
s.src = url;
document.head.appendChild(s);

var createScene = function() {

    //Scene set up code

    s.onload = function() {
        //any code calling on loaded file code
    }
	
    return scene;
}
```
