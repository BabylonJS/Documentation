## Prerequisites

You have to follow and finish the [How to use BabylonJS with Vue](/workflow/Babylon.js+ExternalLibraries/BabylonJS_and_Vue/BabylonJS_and_Vue_1 "How to use BabylonJS with Vue") tutorial first.

These principles have to be clear for you: [Passing of variables by Value and by Reference in Javascript](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/pass-by-value-and-pass-by-reference-in-javascript/ "Passing of variables by Value and by Reference in Javascript").

Basic knowledge about Vue, Vue Components and about data passing between components is crucial for this tutorial. If you are not familiar with these topics, you will not be able to follow the tutorial. You can find the required information for data passing on [The official Vue 2 Components Basic page](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/components.html "Vue 2 Components Basics") and on [The official Vue 3 Components Basic page](https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/component-basics.html "Vue 3 Components Basic").

You need a clone of the repository from https://github.com/RolandCsibrei/babylonjs-vue2-javascript-basic-setup. This is were we left off in part 1, so you can edit along reading the tutorial, or you can clone a repo with all the changes already made from here: https://github.com/RolandCsibrei/babylonjs-vue2-javascript-basic-setup/tree/all.

The goal of this tutorial is to show how to connect the two frameworks together and not how to use these frameworks alone. You need to be familiar with both frameworks at basic level to get started.

This example uses Vue 2. All the techniques are the same for Vue 3, you just have to modify the Vue part of the code to make it working in Vue 3. Basically instead of `data()` you have to declare your variables in the `setup` method and the `mounted` hook is replaced by `onMounted`.

## The Example

We will create an FPS counter which will be displayed by Vue, but the data will be provided by the BabylonJS scene.

1. The first approach will use callbacks to send data from the BabylonJS scene to the Vue component and this component will `emit` the data to it's parent component, where the FPS finally gets displayed. The BabylonJS scene is not exposing any of it's objects to the Vue component.
1. The second approach will expose the BabylonJS `Engine` and `Scene` object to the Vue component and we will get the required data in the Vue component from the exposed `Engine` object.

After finishing this part we will learn how to pass data from the Vue component to the BabylonJS scene and we will make some cubes move.

1. The first approach will not expose any BabylonJS objects to the Vue component and the BabylonJS scene will be controlled via custom methods exposed by the scene.
1. The second approach will expose only the required `Vector3` BabylonJS object with the position of the cube, so we can move our cube by directly modifiying this object's properties. We will read rotation data from a `Vector3` object in our component in real-time as well.
1. The final, third approach will expose the `Engine` and `Scene` object and the Vue component will manipulate the scene by using these objects.

## Passing data from BabylonJS to Vue using callbacks

GitHub: https://github.com/RolandCsibrei/babylonjs-vue2-javascript-basic-setup/tree/fps-by-callback

This is the most verbose but safest, most extendable and reusable approach. Basically you will create methods in the BabylonJS scene code and `export` them accordingly, so they can be `imported` into the Vue component and respectivelly called.

Modify `src/scenes/MyFirstScene.js` and copy paste this code or just follow along if you have cloned the repository for this part. This a simple scene with three cubes, red, yellow and green. The green one is rotating. It is achieved by incrementing the `rotation.y` value on the cube in each frame.

The main change is the addition of the second parameter `fpsCallback` in the `createScene` method. This must be a function with one parameter (the current FPS rate as a number) and will be called each frame.

```jsx
import { Engine, Scene, FreeCamera, Vector3, MeshBuilder, StandardMaterial, Color3, HemisphericLight } from "@babylonjs/core";
const createScene = (canvas, fpsCallback) => {
  const engine = new Engine(canvas);
  const scene = new Scene(engine);

  const camera = new FreeCamera("camera1", new Vector3(0, 5, -10), scene);
  camera.setTarget(Vector3.Zero());
  camera.attachControl(canvas, true);

  new HemisphericLight("light", Vector3.Up(), scene);

  const boxRed = MeshBuilder.CreateBox("box-red", { size: 1 }, scene);
  const materialRed = new StandardMaterial("box-red-material", scene);
  materialRed.diffuseColor = Color3.Red();
  boxRed.material = materialRed;
  boxRed.position.x = -2;

  const boxBlue = MeshBuilder.CreateBox("box-yellow", { size: 1 }, scene);
  const materialYellow = new StandardMaterial("box-blue-material", scene);
  materialYellow.diffuseColor = Color3.Yellow();
  boxBlue.material = materialYellow;

  const boxGreen = MeshBuilder.CreateBox("box-green", { size: 1 }, scene);
  const materialGreen = new StandardMaterial("box-green-material", scene);
  materialGreen.diffuseColor = Color3.Green();
  boxGreen.material = materialGreen;
  boxGreen.position.x = 2;

  engine.runRenderLoop(() => {
    scene.render();

    boxGreen.rotation.y += 0.01;

    if (fpsCallback) {
      fpsCallback(engine.getFps().toFixed());
    }
  });
};

export { createScene };
```

Now open `src/components/BabylonScene.vue` and use this code. The change here is that we've added a callback to our `createScene` method. Our `fpsCallback` method will be called by the BabylonJS scene in each frame as described above. The callback method then `emmits` that FPS value to the parent component, in our example to `App.vue`.

```jsx
<template>
  <div>
    <canvas ref="bjsCanvas" width="500" height="500" />
  </div>
</template>

<script>
import { createScene } from "../scenes/MyFirstScene";

export default {
  name: "BabylonScene",

  mounted() {
    const bjsCanvas = this.$refs.bjsCanvas;
    if (bjsCanvas) {
      const fpsCallback = (fps) => {
        this.$emit("fps", fps);
      };
      createScene(bjsCanvas, fpsCallback);
    }
  },
};
</script>
```

Now open `src/App.vue` and use this code. Please note that we have added a custom event listener to our `BabylonScene.vue` component and a method called `fpsReceived` which just sets `fps`. The `<label>` in the template gets automatically updated. Some styling has been added as well.

```jsx
<template>
  <div>
    <label>{{ fps }}</label>
    <BabylonScene @fps="fpsReceived" />
  </div>
</template>

<script>
import BabylonScene from "./components/BabylonScene.vue";

export default {
  name: "App",
  components: {
    BabylonScene,
  },
  data() {
    return {
      fps: 0,
    };
  },
  methods: {
    fpsReceived(fps) {
      this.fps = fps;
    },
  },
};
</script>

<style>
body {
  padding: 10px;
}

label {
  display: block;
}
</style>
```

That's all, we can run our example by issuing the `npm run serve` command in the terminal. You should see this image. FPS should be displayed in the left upper corner.

## Passing data from BabylonJS to Vue using an exposed Engine object

GitHub: https://github.com/RolandCsibrei/babylonjs-vue2-javascript-basic-setup/tree/fps-by-exposed-engine

Open `src/components/BabylonScene.vue` and use this code. The big changes here are that the `createScene` method returns the `Engine` and the `Scene` objects, so they are exposed to the Vue component and the component can directly access them. We store these two objects into our Vue component for later access. Just right after that we create an interval to `emit` the FPS value to the parent `App.vue` component every 1 second. We get the FPS value from the exposed BabylonJS `Engine` object directly in our Vue component.

```jsx
<template>
  <div>
    <canvas ref="bjsCanvas" width="500" height="500" />
  </div>
</template>

<script>
import { createScene } from "../scenes/MyFirstScene";

export default {
  name: "BabylonScene",

  data() {
    return {
      scene: null,
      engine: null,
      interval: null,
    };
  },

  methods: {
    setupFpsEmitter() {
      const interval = setInterval(() => {
        const fps = this.engine.getFps().toFixed();
        this.$emit("fps", fps);
      }, 1000);
      this.interval = interval;
    },
  },
  mounted() {
    const bjsCanvas = this.$refs.bjsCanvas;
    if (bjsCanvas) {
      const { engine, scene } = createScene(bjsCanvas);
      this.engine = engine;
      this.scene = scene;

      this.setupFpsEmitter();
    }
  },
  unmounted() {
    if (this.interval) {
      clearInterval(this.interval);
    }
  },
};
</script>
```

Edit `src/scenes/MyFirstScene.js` and add

```jsx
return { engine, scene };
```

at the end of the `createScene` method. If you are getting lost, please have a look at the code in the repository.

Now it's time to run our app as usual and the result must be the same as with the callbacks.

## Sending data from Vue to BabylonJS with loose coupling and without exposing the BabylonJS objects to Vue

GitHub: https://github.com/RolandCsibrei/babylonjs-vue2-javascript-basic-setup/tree/vue-to-bjs-no-expose

As already written, we simply create a method for everything we need to access or manipulate. Modify the `src/scenes/MyFirstScene.js` BabylonJS scene file and `export` these methods so they can be imported in the Vue component.

We need to wrap our methods and properties into an object, in our case called `myScene` and `export` this object, so we can store the `Engine` and the `Scene` objects into this object:

```jsx
const myScene = {
  engine: null,
  scene: null,
  createScene: function(canvas) {
    const engine = new Engine(canvas);
```

At the end add a method as follows. This method can be called by any caller, including our Vue component and it simply repositions a mesh identified by the name parameter `name`.

```jsx
  setPosition: function(name, x, y, z) {
    const mesh = this.scene.getMeshByName(name);
    if (mesh) {
      mesh.position = new Vector3(x, y, z);
    }
  },
```

Our `App.vue` must be changed like this. We've added a button which triggers the yellow cube's movement. We are injecting the `cubePosition` object into our `BabylonScene` Vue component using it's property called `position`. Than there are simple helper methods just to make some movement.

```jsx
<template>
  <div>
    <button @click="moveCube">Move Cube</button>
    <BabylonScene :position="cubePosition" />
  </div>
</template>

<script>
import BabylonScene from "./components/BabylonScene.vue";

export default {
  name: "App",
  components: {
    BabylonScene,
  },
  data() {
    return {
      cubePosition: {},

      offset: 0,
      x: 0,
      y: 0,
      z: 0,
    };
  },
  methods: {
    moveCube() {
      this.getNextPosition();
      this.moveCubeTheRightWay();
    },
    moveCubeTheRightWay() {
      this.cubePosition = { x: 2, y: this.y, z: this.z };
    },
    getNextPosition() {
      this.offset += 0.5;
      this.x = 0;
      this.y = 0 + this.offset;
      this.z = 0;
    },
  },
};
</script>
```

When changing the `cubePosition` object in the code above, the `BabylonScene` Vue component will automatically retrieve this object in its property. So open `src/components/BabylonScene.vue` and let's look at the changes.

We are exporting our BabylonJS scene from `MyFirstScene.js` as default, so we don't use curly braces when importing a default export. We've defined a property called `position` with a default value. This property will receive the `cubePosition` object from `App.vue`. We would like to be notified about the changes, so we setup a Vue `watcher` which will simply call the BabylonJS scene method for positioning the cube.

```jsx
<script>
import myScene from "../scenes/MyFirstScene";

export default {
  name: "BabylonScene",
  props: {
    position: {
      type: Object,
      default() {
        return { x: 0, y: 0, z: 0 };
      },
    },
  },

  watch: {
    position(val) {
      if (val) {
        myScene.setPosition("box-green", val.x, val.y, val.z);
      }
    },
  },
  mounted() {
    const bjsCanvas = this.$refs.bjsCanvas;
    if (bjsCanvas) {
      myScene.createScene(bjsCanvas);
    }
  },
};
</script>
```

You can now start the app and you should see the following. Click on the button to move the green cube upwards.

![Running the Vue 2 BabylonJS no expose sample](/img/resources/vue/bjs-vue-doc-3.png)

## Sending data from Vue to BabylonJS and vice versa with an exposed BabylonJS Vector3 object

GitHub: https://github.com/RolandCsibrei/babylonjs-vue2-javascript-basic-setup/tree/vue-to-bjs-exposed-vector3

In this example we will show the communication using an exposed BabylonJS object. In the last method we will expose the `Engine` and the `Scene` objects. Expose so little, so little you can. Exposing only a `Vector3` is far more better, than exposing for example the whole `Scene`.

In this scenario we get the required `Vector3` objects from the BabylonJS scene by invoking methods on it. We use the methods `getPosition` and `getRotation`. We `emit` these `Vector3` objects to the parent component, to `App.vue` afterwards, where the data gets displayed.

So we have added these methods to `src/scenes/MyFirstScene.js`. Pretty simple, isn't it?

```jsx
 getPosition: function(name) {
    const mesh = this.scene.getMeshByName(name);
    if (mesh) {
      return mesh.position;
    }
  },

  getRotation: function(name) {
    const mesh = this.scene.getMeshByName(name);
    if (mesh) {
      return mesh.rotation;
    }
  },
```

Now we can make changes in `src/components/BabylonScene.vue`. We get two objects, the `position` of the yellow cube and the `rotation` of the green cube. We then `emit` these objects to the parent component. We have to call the functions which emits the data in the `mounted` callback after the scene was created.

```jsx
 methods: {
    emitPositionVector() {
      const bjsPositionVector = myScene.getPosition("box-yellow", this.scene);
      this.$emit("bjsPositionVector", bjsPositionVector);
    },
    emitRotationVector() {
      const bjsRotationVector = myScene.getRotation("box-green", this.scene);
      this.$emit("bjsRotationVector", bjsRotationVector);
    },
  },
  mounted() {
    const bjsCanvas = this.$refs.bjsCanvas;
    if (bjsCanvas) {
      myScene.createScene(bjsCanvas);

      this.emitPositionVector();
      this.emitRotationVector();
    }
  },
```

Finally our parent component `src/components/App.vue`. We've added two labels. The labels gets automatically updated, when the `rotation` stored in `bjsRotationVector.y` gets updated and the `position`, it's the same story.

Next we have a `button`, which calls `moveCube` when clicked. This method calls some other helper methods which alters the values and the important part is in the method `moveCubeSharedVector`, where we set the `y` property directly on the BabylonJS `Vector3` object. Keep in mind, that this will work until the original `Vector3` is still existing and is still the same object. If the `Vector3` is changed in the scene code, the Vue component will not know about it. So you have to be careful, what are you doing.

The same goes on with the `bjsRotationVector`. Vue is displaying the `y` property directly from the BabylonJS `Vector3` object. The same applies here, if you loose the object reference, this will stop working.

```jsx
<template>
  <div>
    <label v-if="bjsRotationVector"
      >Green Rotation Y: {{ bjsRotationVector.y }}</label
    >
    <label v-if="bjsPositionVector"
      >Yellow Position:{{ bjsPositionVector }}</label
    >
    <button @click="moveCube">Move Yellow Cube</button>
    <BabylonScene
      @bjsPositionVector="bjsPositionVectorReceived"
      @bjsRotationVector="bjsRotationVectorReceived"
      :position="cubePosition"
    />
  </div>
</template>

<script>
import BabylonScene from "./components/BabylonScene.vue";

export default {
  name: "App",
  components: {
    BabylonScene,
  },
  data() {
    return {
      cubePosition: {},

      offset: 0,
      x: 0,
      y: 0,
      z: 0,

      bjsPositionVector: null,
      bjsRotationVector: null,
    };
  },
  methods: {
    bjsPositionVectorReceived(bjsPositionVector) {
      this.bjsPositionVector = bjsPositionVector;
    },
    bjsRotationVectorReceived(bjsRotationVector) {
      this.bjsRotationVector = bjsRotationVector;
    },
    moveCube() {
      this.getNextPosition();

      this.moveCubeSharedVector();
    },

    moveCubeSharedScene() {
      this.cubePosition = { x: -2, y: this.y, z: this.z };
    },
    moveCubeSharedVector() {
      if (this.bjsPositionVector) {
        // this.bjsPositionVector = new Vector3(0, this.y, this.z);
        // the line above will not work, you must not create a new object
        // but you have to modify the existing one's properties
        this.bjsPositionVector.y = this.y;
      }
    },

    getNextPosition() {
      this.offset += 0.5;
      this.x = 0;
      this.y = 0 + this.offset;
      this.z = 0;
    },
  },
};
</script>
```

After running the app, you should see this screen:

![Running the Vue to BabylonJS expose Vector3 sample](/img/resources/vue/bjs-vue-doc-4.png)

## Sending data from Vue to BabylonJS with an exposed BabylonJS Engine and Scene object

GitHub: https://github.com/RolandCsibrei/babylonjs-vue2-javascript-basic-setup/tree/vue-to-bjs-exposed-engine

And finally the third method we are going to try is to expose the `Engine` and the `Scene` object to the `BabylonScene` Vue component.

Make sure the scene code in `src/scenes/MyFirstScene.js` returns the `Engine` and the `Scene` object from the `createScene` method:

```jsx
return { engine, scene };
```

Open `src/components/BabylonScene.vue` and make these modifications. We need a `data` section to store the `Engine` and `Scene` for later use. We create the scene and get these objects in the `mounted` callback. We have a Vue property, which receives the position for the red cube. We want to react to changes in this property, so we setup a `watch`er for the property `position`. When changed and here comes the interesting part, we directly access the BabylonJS `Scene` object and calling directly it's methods to reposition the red cube.

```jsx
props: {
  position: {
    type: Object,
    default() {
      return { x: 0, y: 0, z: 0 };
    },
  },
},
data() {
  return {
    scene: null,
    engine: null,
  };
},
watch: {
  position(val) {
    if (val) {
      const box = this.scene.getMeshByName("box-red");
      const position = new Vector3(val.x, val.y, val.z);
      if (box) {
        box.position = position;
      }
    }
  },
},
mounted() {
  const bjsCanvas = this.$refs.bjsCanvas;
  if (bjsCanvas) {
    const { engine, scene } = createScene(bjsCanvas);
    this.engine = engine;
    this.scene = scene;
  }
},
```

## Other methods of data passing

There are much more methods to pass data between Vue and BabylonJS, generally in Javascript as well. We have demonstrated only a few techniques. If you are interested in `WebWorkers` and want to use the offline canvas rendering capability of BabylonJS, you have to choose data communication using messaging.

## Conclusion

As you can see, it's up to the programmer to choose the right approach. There is a safer, but slower and more verbose way and there are methods less safe, but quicker. Just keep in mind, that exposing objects from BabylonJS to Vue and make them reactive in Vue is quite dangerous. You can end up with multiple canvas redraws in one tick.

Now the we've learned how to control the scene from Vue, it can be very tempting to overuse this technique. Keep your data flow between Vue and BabylonJS at minimum and for example do not animate an object on the scene by setting it's properties from Vue every frame, create a method on the scene instead, let's call it `animateMeshVisibility(name, from, to, duration)` and call this method from Vue once to start the animation.
