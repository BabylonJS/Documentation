## Interactions
Possibly the most important interactions you can have are user interactions when picking a mesh in the scene for example. These can be achieved with scene observables. 

You often also need to find whether to meshes are intersecting or the relative position of a mesh with reference to another mesh, camera or point in space. These can be achieved in Babylon.js using *intersectsMesh*, for two meshes and for ray casting *Ray* and *intersect*.
