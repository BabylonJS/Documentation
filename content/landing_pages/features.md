## Features
This category provides support in creating 3D scene from getting started, in the Playground, with basic camera, light and shapes to multiple scenes with photorealistic textures and 3D environments.

## Getting Started
Our online playground allows you to view, explore and create 3D scenes with all the support structure done for you behind the scenes, pun intended.

This playground 

shows the basic code required to create a 3D scene.

A scene, camera and light must always be present. In this case a sphere and a ground have been created. Try changing the diameter of the sphere or the width of the ground. After any editing just select the run button |\> to rebuild the scene.
