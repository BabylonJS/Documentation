## Welcome To The Babylon.js Documentation

Hello and welcome to the Babylon.js Documentation. In these pages you will find everything you could ever want to know about this powerful, beautiful, simple, and completely open-source web rendering engine. Whether you are just starting your Babylon.js journey, or you are a seasoned veteran, it is our sincere hope that the information contained here will help you bring your ideas to life.

We know that each person comes to Babylon.js with their own individual background, experiences, and learning style. We also understand that each one of you has a different goal in mind for your learning journey. We have done our best to organize these doc pages to help the largest number of people achieve their learning goals as efficiently as possible. With two parts to our whole documentation – knowing that many of you want to dive right into Babylon.js, learning about the engine and its features, while others of you prefer to start by understanding how to get Babylon.js set up and integrated into a web application – you'll find paths optimized for each of these learning styles in the coming pages.

However, before you go any further, we strongly encourage (and humbly ask) EVERYONE to [Start Your Babylon.js Journey Here.](journey/theFirstStep)
