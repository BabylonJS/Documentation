## Welcome To The Babylon.js Documentation

Hello and welcome to the Babylon.js Documentation. In these pages you will find everything you could ever want to know about this powerful, beautiful, simple, and completely open-source web rendering engine. Whether you are just starting your Babylon.js journey, or you are a seasoned veteran, it is our sincere hope that the information contained here will help you bring your ideas to life.

We know that each person comes to Babylon.js with different backgrounds, experiences, and learning styles. We also understand that each one of you has a different goal in mind for your learning journey. We've done our best to organize these doc pages to help the most amount of people reach their learning goals as effeciently as possible. Though 2 parts of a whole, we know that many of you want to dive right into Babylon.js, learning about the engine and its features. While others of you prefer to start by understanding how to get Babylon.js set up and integrated into a web application. You'll find learning paths for both of these interests in the coming pages.

However, before you go any further, we strongly encourage (and humbly ask) EVERYONE to [Start Your Babylon.js Journey Here.](journey/theFirstStep)
