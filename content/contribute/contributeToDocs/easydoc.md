This is the quickest way to correct spelling and grammar errors or to add sentences or paragraph or two to clarify an explanation.

Requirements: you just need a [Github](https://github.com) account and a Fork of  the [Documentation](https://github.com/BabylonJS/Documentation) repository.

At the bottom of each Documentation page you will see the github icon

![Github](/img/contribute/GitHub-Mark.png)

Select this and it will take you to the correct Github page from where you select the edit button:

![quick edit](/img/contribute/documentation/easy-edit.png)

You can now [use markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) to edit the documentation page.

Once done, try to quickly explain what your modification is for, and click on the _Propose file change_ button:
