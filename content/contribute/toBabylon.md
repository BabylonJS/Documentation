## Introduction

Babylon.js is maintained on Github, a web-based hosting service for version control using Git. Familiarity with using Github is necessary for you to contribute.

## Pre-Requisites

- Installation of Node.js, NPM, Git, Typescript, and have a Github Account;
- A fork and clone of Babylon.js;
- Reading the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/BabylonJS/Babylon.js/blob/master/contributing.md);
- An IDE such as VSCode;
- An ability to code in Typescript. Babylon.js is written in Typescript then compiled and distributed in JavaScript.

You can find the required Typescript version by checking  `package.json` in the [Babylon.js repository](https://github.com/BabylonJS/Babylon.js/blob/master/package.json).
