## What to Expect
This page is a breakdown of each node available in the Node Geometry Editor. The nodes will be listed in the same order by group as they are in the tool's node list. The reason for this order is that there may be some generalities that apply to all nodes in a group and those will be listed once rather than repeating them for each node. For each node we will discuss all inputs, outputs, properties, and considerations to ensure all requirements for using a node are highlighted. 

## Sources
Source nodes are a requirement for any Node Geometry graph as they supply the Geometry that is needed by the `GeometryOutput` node for the graph to be able to build. Most of these nodes will come with multiple inputs that will set the basic properties of the Geometry, but all have exactly one output which is Geometry generated by the source node. 

Each parameter that can be set for the source Geometry can either be set by connecting a node or nodes to set a specific value or it can be set in the properties of the node. If a parameter's port on the node is connected by a wire, the parameter is removed from the parameter list on the node as it is deriving its value from the connected node(s). 

If there is a set of connected properties - such as size, width, height, and depth - the more specific properties take precedence over the more general properties. In other words, if values are passed to size AND width then the parameter passed to width will apply to the width of the Geometry and height and depth will take their values from size. In this way, it is normal to see values wired to both general and specific properties at the same time. If, however, there are values passed to size, width, height, and depth then the value passed to size is not used at all and is not needed.

<H3Image title="Box" image="/img/tools/nge/boxNode.jpg" alt="Box source node"/>
This source node creates a box to the dimensions given at the resolution set by subdivisions as follows. 

#### Properties
Note that these properties only appear when there is nothing connected to the corresponding input on the node.
- **size** is the value used for width, depth, and height of the box.
- **width** sets the width of the box and overrides any value in size.
- **height** sets the height of the box and overrides any value in size.
- **depth** sets the depth of the box and overrides any value in size.
- **subdivisions** sets the resolution in X, Y, and Z for the box.
- **subdivisionsX** sets the resolution in X for the box and overrides any value set in subdivisions.
- **subdivisionsY** sets the resolution in Y for the box and overrides any value set in subdivisions.
- **subdivisionsZ** sets the resolution in Z for the box and overrides any value set in subdivisions.

#### Debug Infos
- **Call count** shows the number of times this node is called by nodes further into the graph. This is the total number of calls from all subsequent nodes. 
- **Execution count** shows the number of times this node is executed. This value will affect the performance of the graph. Depending on the value of *Evaluate context* on nodes further in the graph the values for *Execution count* may be lower than the value for *Call count*. 

#### Advanced
- **Evaluate context** determines whether any nodes connected after this one can instruct this node to evaluate its context again. There are two considerations to keep in mind here. The first is the importance of this node delivering the same data to each connected node and the second is how much extra processing time is needed to evaluate context again. If it is important that this node return the same data for each connected node, set **Evaluate context** to false or any procedurally generated data feeding this node will generate new data for each connected node. If generating a new data set for each connected node is desirable, set this property to true. This also applies to nodes that loop which will request a new evaluation of the context for each iteration of the loop if this property is set to true. If there are no procedural nodes feeding this one or all procedural nodes are locked, disable this property to optimize build time. There is no reason to evaluate the context if the data feeding this node does not change. As the graph gets more complex and looping nodes nest it quickly becomes apparent that disabling **Evaluate context** improves performance and is recommended where possible.

#### Inputs
- **size** is the value used for width, depth, and height of the box.

## Inputs
Input nodes consist of basic value types used to set properties on other nodes. There are a few common properties on all input nodes. Those consist of the following.

- **Mode** allows the input to be defined as a user-defined value or a contextual value of any type. User-defined values are just as they seem, the user assigned a constant value to the node. A contextual value is derived from the closest geometry node associated with this node. Changing mode to a different value can also change the type of data the node represents. For example, a Float input can be changed to a Vector2 contextual value which will change the data type supplied by the node. Be aware of this when changing mode as it can affect connections to other nodes. Note that if mode is set to a contextual value, the node will no longer display *Visible on frame*, *Min*, *Max*, or *Value* in the node properties but will instead display *Contextual value*.
- **Contextual value** assigns the source of the data for any input set to a contextual value. The sources available depend on the data type selected for the input node. For example, choosing a Int contextual value allows access to vertex IDs and choosing a Vector3 contextual value would offer vertex positions.
- **Visible on frame** is a boolean which allows any input contained within a frame to be visible in the INPUTS list of the properties panel for a frame. Simply enable the boolean and then whenever a frame is selected - expanded or collapsed - any visible input can have its value changed directly in the frame properties panel.

<H3Image title="Float" image="/img/tools/nge/floatNode.jpg" alt="Float input node"/>
This input node represents a Float value rounded to four decimal places. The node contains the following properties which can be set in the properties panel. 

#### Debug Infos
- **Call count** shows the number of times this node is called by nodes further into the graph. This is the total number of calls from all subsequent nodes. 
- **Execution count** shows the number of times this node is executed. This value will affect the performance of the graph. Depending on the value of *Evaluate context* on nodes further in the graph the values for *Execution count* may be lower than the value for *Call count*. 

#### Properties
- **Mode** [see description above](/toolsAndResources/nge/customFrames#inputs-9).
- **Min** provides the minimum value and if set, the node will create a slider between minimum and maximum values. For the slider to work correctly, ensure that the Min value is lower than Max value.
- **Max** provides the maximum value and if set, the node will create a slider between minimum and maximum values. For the slider to work correctly, ensure that the Max value is higher than Min value.
- **Value** is a user defined value that is either an input field or a combination of input field and slider if Min and Max are set. The value set in the field will be rounded to four decimal places by default.
- **Visible on frame** [see description above](/toolsAndResources/nge/customFrames#inputs-9).

## Contextual
Contextual nodes consist of values derived from the closest source associated with a contextual node in the graph. The way to determine what source is referenced by a contextual value is to trace wires from the contextual value node until finding a node that has a reference that could supply the context. For contextual nodes that reference geometric values like position or normal, trace wires to the first node that references geometry, and this will be the source that is being referenced.

![Tracing contextual values to their source geometry](/img/tools/nge/tracingContext.jpg)

In addition to geometric contextual values, there are other types of contextual values. One of them being LoopID which is a contextual value for the iteration of a node that loops. In this case, tracing wires to the first node that is iterable would be the source for the contextual value.  

![Tracing non-geometric contextual values to their source](/img/tools/nge/tracingContext2.jpg)

To help in identifying what source is feeding a contextual value, the graph will highlight the node providing the source of the contextual value when selecting any contextual value as can be seen in the images above. The playground below can be used to experiment with contextual values and better understand how they reference their source.

Contextual nodes are typically an array of values determined by the components of the source such as the vertices of referenced geometry or There are a couple of common properties on all input nodes. Those consist of the following.

- **Mode** allows the node to be defined as a user-defined value or a contextual value of any type. User-defined values are just as they seem, the user assigned a constant value to the node. A contextual value is derived from the closest geometry node associated with this node. Changing mode to a different value can also change the type of data the node represents. For example, a CollectionID contextual node can be updated to a Vector2 contextual value which will change the data type supplied by the node. Be aware of this when changing mode as it can affect connections to other nodes. Note that if mode is changed to user-defined, the node will no longer display *Contextual value* but will instead show *Visible on frame*, *Min*, *Max*, and *Value* in the node properties.
- **Contextual value** assigns the source of the data for any input set to a contextual value. The sources available depend on the data type selected for the input node. For example, choosing a Int contextual value allows access to vertex IDs and choosing a Vector3 contextual value would offer vertex positions.

## Logical
Logical nodes are used to branch a node graph by performing a test between two Float values. If the test between the two values meets the condition set by the node, a value of true is returned and the nodes connected to the ifTrue port are passed to the output. Otherwise, the nodes connected to the ifFalse port are passed to the output. There are common properties that are possessed by all logical nodes and are as follows.

- **ifTrue and ifFalse** ports on each logical node do not need to be connected to anything for the node to function. If a node is connected to ifTrue or ifFalse, that node will be passed when appropriate condition is met. If nothing is connected to ifTrue or ifFalse, the node will output 1.0 and 0.0 respectively. This allows for successive logical tests by testing if the previous logical test was true (1.0) or false (0.0) without the need to wire Float nodes for ifTrue and ifFalse in the graph.

<H3Image title="And" image="/img/tools/nge/andNode.jpg" alt="And node"/>
This logical node tests if the Float value in the left port and the right port are both not equal to 0.0. If the test returns true, the value of ifTrue is passed otherwise the value of ifFalse is passed. 

#### Properties
- **right** is an input field to be able to set a Float value for the right port manually. This is a shortcut to help reduce complexity on the graph if the test needs to be done against a constant value. 

#### Debug Infos
- **Call count** shows the number of times this node is called by nodes further into the graph. This is the total number of calls from all subsequent nodes. 
- **Execution count** shows the number of times this node is executed. This value will affect the performance of the graph. Depending on the value of *Evaluate context* on nodes further in the graph the values for *Execution count* may be lower than the value for *Call count*. 

#### Advanced
- **Test** sets the condition for the comparison between the two values connected to the node. Any logical can be easily changed to another logical node simply by changing the Test parameter without needing to replace the node with a different logical node.

#### Inputs
- **left** is connected to a node providing a Float value to be used in the test.
- **right** can be connected to a node providing a Float value to be used in the test or a constant value can be set in the input field of the properties panel for this node.
- **ifTrue** can be connected to any data type including geometry but needs to be the same data type as connected to ifFalse and will determine the data type for the output port on this node. If nothing is connected, the value assumed by ifTrue is 1.0.
- **ifFalse** can be connected to any data type including geometry but needs to be the same data type as connected to ifTrue and will determine the data type for the output port on this node. If nothing is connected, the value assumed by ifFalse is 0.0.

#### Outputs
- **output** is the value attached to ifTrue if the test returns true or the value attached to ifFalse if the test returns false. If one or both ports for ifTrue and ifFalse are not connected, the output passes 1.0 if the test returns true and 0.0 if the test returns false.

<H3Image title="Equal" image="/img/tools/nge/equalNode.jpg" alt="Equal node"/>

<H3Image title="Transform" image="/img/tools/nge/transformNode.jpg" alt="Transform node"/>
This function transforms the input geometry using either a custom Matrix or a Vector3 input for translation, rotation, and scaling. The required input for this node is the geometry input and the output will also be geometry. The rest of the inputs are optional, but if providing a Matrix input to the node, the translation, rotation, and scale inputs will be ignored as the Matrix takes precedence over the individual transform inputs. 

#### Properties
- **translation** is an input field for a Vector3 value to be used to translate the position of the geometry. This property is only visible if there is no wire connected to the translation input.
- **rotation** is an input field for a Vector3 value in radians to be used to set the rotation of the geometry. This property is only visible if there is no wire connected to the rotation input.
- **scaling** is an input field for a Vector3 value to be used to set the scale of the geometry. This property is only visible if there is no wire connected to the scaling input.

#### Advanced
- **Evaluate context** determines whether any nodes connected after this one can instruct this node to evaluate its context again. There are two considerations to keep in mind here. The first is the importance of this node delivering the same data to each connected node and the second is how much extra processing time is needed to evaluate context again. If it is important that this node return the same data for each connected node, set **Evaluate context** to false or any procedurally generated data feeding this node will generate new data for each connected node. If generating a new data set for each connected node is desirable, set this property to true. This also applies to nodes that loop which will request a new evaluation of the context for each iteration of the loop if this property is set to true. If there are no procedural nodes feeding this one or all procedural nodes are locked, disable this property to optimize build time. There is no reason to evaluate the context if the data feeding this node does not change. As the graph gets more complex and looping nodes nest it quickly becomes apparent that disabling **Evaluate context** improves performance and is recommended where possible.

#### Inputs

<H3Image title="VectorConverter" image="/img/tools/nge/converterNode.jpg" alt="Vector converter node"/>
This node is used to either split a vector into its components or assemble components into a vector. This node has a lot of utility for introducing a change into one or more components of a vector based on the need of the user. It can also be used to swizzle components or assemble components in several ways to make up a vector. Each input will override the narrower inputs below it. For example, a Vector4 connected to the xyzw input will override any values connected to xyz, xy, zw, x, y, z, or w. The process is the same for each input so any value connected to the xy input will override any values connected to the x and y inputs. 

The values provided by the outputs depend entirely on the values connected to the inputs. The node will work from the top input down and assemble a Vector4 value which can then be referenced from any of the outputs. If there is a component of the Vector4 output that was not defined in the input, the value of that component will be 0.0. This means if you only connect values to the x, y, and z inputs there will still be a Vector4 value available in the xyzw output that has 0.0 for the value of w. Since the inputs work from the top down, the VectorConverter will work with various combinations. For example, connecting values to the xy input as well as the z and w inputs will create a complete Vector4 value with no overrides. However, if connecting values to the xyz input as well as the z and w inputs will create a Vector4 of the xyz input and the w input, ignoring the value connected to the z input.

## Instances
These nodes are used to create instances of input geometry in one of several different methods. In all cases, multiple instances of a specific, non-null geometry are created but the differences come in where they are instantiated and how many instances are created. Several of these nodes use a separate piece of geometry to drive position and location for instances, but this can also be done by setting positions and count manually. Each node in this set, however, outputs only the instanced geometry and not the source geometry used to generate positions and/or number of instances. Additionally, these nodes generate a single geometry rather than individual instances, so there is no need to merge them after these nodes.

<H3Image title="Instantiate" image="/img/tools/nge/instantiateNode.jpg" alt="Instantiate node"/>
This node generates instances of non-null geometry wired to an input based on the count input. If a null geometry is passed to the node during an iteration, the node will continue to iterate until the required number of non-null instances are created. These instances will be output as a single geometry rather than multiple instanced meshes. The transform of each instance is taken from the matrix input which will override the inputs below it OR is taken from the inputs for position, rotation, and scaling. Like the Vector Converter node, if the matrix input is connected then position, rotation, and scaling are ignored as the matrix input will account for the entire transformation of the instance.

#### Properties
- **count** is an input field for an Int value to be used to determine the number of instances to create. This property is only visible if there is no wire connected to the count input.
- **position** is an input field for a Vector3 value to be used to set the position of each instance. This property is only visible if there is no wire connected to the translation input.

This node generates instances of non-null geometry wired to the input based on the count input. These instances are created in a straight line offsetting each instance by the value of direction.

<H3Image title="InstantiateOnFaces" image="/img/tools/nge/instantiateOnFacesNode.jpg" alt="Instantiate on faces node"/>
This node generates instances of non-null geometry wired to the instance input on this node. If a null geometry is passed to the node during an iteration, the node will continue to iterate until the required number of non-null instances are created. These instances will be output as a single geometry rather than multiple instanced meshes. The instance positions are driven by a source geometry connected to the geometry input. Each instance will be distributed across the available faces of the source mesh. The position of each mesh will be a randomly generated position coplanar with and within the bounds of the target face. If there are fewer instances than faces on the source geometry, not every face will be assigned an instance. However, if there are more instances than faces in the source mesh, each face in the source mesh will be assigned one or more instances. If there is a connection made to the matrix input of this node, the transformation of each instance will be driven from this input. Any connections made to the matrix input will override any connections made to the inputs below it. If nothing is connected to the matrix input, the transformation is taken from any connections to inputs for position, rotation, and scaling.

#### Properties

- **scaling** is connected to a node providing a Vector3 to set the scaling for each instance.

#### Outputs
- **output** is the geometry generated from the node. No matter how many instances were created with this node, the output will be a single geometry that has been automatically merged. 

<H3Image title="InstantiateOnVertices" image="/img/tools/nge/instantiateOnVerticesNode.jpg" alt="Instantiate on vertices node"/>
This node generates instances of non-null geometry wired to the instance input on this node. If a null geometry is passed to the node during an iteration, the node will continue to iterate until the required number of non-null instances are created. These instances will be output as a single geometry rather than multiple instanced meshes. The instance positions are driven by a source geometry connected to the geometry input. The number of instances created will be determined by the vertex count of the source geometry and the density input value using a 0.0 - 1.0 range. Density defines the percentage of randomly selected vertices that will have an instance created at its position and each will receive exactly one instance. If there is a connection made to the matrix input of this node, the transformation of each instance will be driven from this input. Any connections made to the matrix input will override any connections made to the inputs below it. If nothing is connected to the matrix input, the transformation is taken from any connections to inputs for position, rotation, and scaling.

#### Properties
- **density** is an input field for a float value with a range of 0.0 - 1.0 which determines the percentage of randomly selected vertices that are eligible to for an instance. This property is only visible if there is no wire connected to the count input.
- **rotation** is an input field for a Vector3 value in radians to be used to set the rotation of each instance. This property is only visible if there is no wire connected to the rotation input.
- **scaling** is an input field for a Vector3 value to be used to set the scale of each instance. This property is only visible if there is no wire connected to the scaling input.

#### Debug Infos
- **Call count** shows the number of times this node is called by nodes further into the graph. This is the total number of calls from all subsequent nodes. 
- **Execution count** shows the number of times this node is executed. This value will affect the performance of the graph. Depending on the value of *Evaluate context* on nodes further in the graph the values for *Execution count* may be lower than the value for *Call count*. 

#### Advanced
- **Evaluate context** determines whether any nodes connected after this one can instruct this node to evaluate its context again. There are two considerations to keep in mind here. The first is the importance of this node delivering the same data to each connected node and the second is how much extra processing time is needed to evaluate context again. If it is important that this node return the same data for each connected node, set **Evaluate context** to false or any procedurally generated data feeding this node will generate new data for each connected node. If generating a new data set for each connected node is desirable, set this property to true. This also applies to nodes that loop which will request a new evaluation of the context for each iteration of the loop if this property is set to true. If there are no procedural nodes feeding this one or all procedural nodes are locked, disable this property to optimize build time. There is no reason to evaluate the context if the data feeding this node does not change. As the graph gets more complex and looping nodes nest it quickly becomes apparent that disabling **Evaluate context** improves performance and is recommended where possible.
- **Remove duplicate positions** is used to prevent instances from being assigned to vertices that share the same position with another vertex in the source geometry.

#### Inputs
- **geometry** is connected to a node providing a source geometry to distribute instances upon.
- **instance** is connected to a node providing a geometry from which to create instances.
- **density** is connected to a node providing an Float value in a range of 0.0 - 1.0 which determines the percentage of randomly selected vertices that are eligible for an instance.
- **matrix** is connected to a node providing a transformation matrix to set position, rotation, and scaling for each instance.

<H3Image title="InstantiateOnVolume" image="/img/tools/nge/instantiateOnVolume.jpg" alt="Instantiate on volume node"/>
This node generates instances of non-null geometry wired to the instance input on this node. If a null geometry is passed to the node during an iteration, the node will continue to iterate until the required number of non-null instances are created. These instances will be output as a single geometry rather than multiple instanced meshes. The instance positions are driven by a source geometry connected to the geometry input. All instances created will be positioned randomly within the source mesh volume. The number of instances created will be determined by the value connected to the count input on the node. If there is a connection made to the matrix input of this node, the transformation of each instance will be driven from this input. Any connections made to the matrix input will override any connections made to the inputs below it. If nothing is connected to the matrix input, the transformation is taken from any connections to inputs for position, rotation, and scaling.

Note that this node needs to make several ray casts to ensure all instances fall within the volume of the source mesh so this node can be quite slow. Keeping the source mesh simple and the number of instances few will help optimize the time this node requires, but expect this node to be resource intensive whenever it is used.  

#### Properties
- **count** is an input field for an Int value to be used to determine the number of instances to create. This property is only visible if there is no wire connected to the count input.
- **rotation** is an input field for a Vector3 value in radians to be used to set the rotation of each instance. This property is only visible if there is no wire connected to the rotation input.
- **scaling** is an input field for a Vector3 value to be used to set the scale of each instance. This property is only visible if there is no wire connected to the scaling input.

#### Debug Infos
- **Call count** shows the number of times this node is called by nodes further into the graph. This is the total number of calls from all subsequent nodes. 
- **Execution count** shows the number of times this node is executed. This value will affect the performance of the graph. Depending on the value of *Evaluate context* on nodes further in the graph the values for *Execution count* may be lower than the value for *Call count*.

## Misc
These nodes are largely to help with organization and debugging a graph, but there is also some utility to be found in them. Node graphs are notorious for being difficult to read once they get complex due to the spaghetti of wires that often occurs within large graphs. That's where both the teleport nodes and the elbow node come in. These nodes help reduce some of the wire complexity in graphs, making them much easier to read. Debugging the graph can also be challenging especially when large arrays of values are being pushed through the graph. The debug node is crucial for being able to see values passed along any wire at any point. Lastly, the GeometryInfo node can be used as easily to debug the graph as it can to drive logic within.

<H3Image title="Debug" image="/img/tools/nge/debugNode.jpg" alt="Debug node"/>
The debug node is a very simple node that can be connected to Float, Int, Vector2, Vector3, Vector4, and Matrix types. While the node can be manually connected between two nodes, simply dropping a debug from the graph on an existing wire of a supported type will automatically connect the node in the middle of the existing wire. Alternatively a debug node can be inserted into an existing wire simply by holding crtl and left clicking any compatible wire. And while these methods of quickly inserting a debug node require it to be inserted between two nodes, the debug node does not require a connection to its output to function. It can be a terminal node in the graph if needed to debug a value that isn't easily connected back to the graph flow.

The node doesn't do any calculations in the graph, only displays the values carried along the wire in the properties panel. Simply select the node and the panel will display whatever value is being passed. This also works for iterable nodes that may contain an array of values. Since the debug node is only used to display information in the UI, there is no cost to the node and debug nodes can be left within a graph much like an elbow node if desired.

**Note**: There will be times when the display of debug values will be truncated due to the length of the values not fitting within the width of the UI panel. If this happens, simply hover the cursor over any displayed value and a tooltip will appear showing the value in its entirety. 

#### Debug Infos
- **Call count** shows the number of times this node is called by nodes further into the graph. This is the total number of calls from all subsequent nodes. 
- **Execution count** shows the number of times this node is executed. This value will affect the performance of the graph. Depending on the value of *Evaluate context* on nodes further in the graph the values for *Execution count* may be lower than the value for *Call count*. 

#### Inputs
- **input** can be connected to a node providing a Float, Int, Vector2, Vector3, Vector4, or Matrix type.

#### Outputs
- **output** is a passthrough of the value connected to input of the same type. Note that the debug node only works if it is connected to a path that reaches the GeometryOutput node. If the output does not connect to GeometryOutput at some point, this node won't be evaluated and will not show any debug values when selected.

<H3Image title="Elbow" image="/img/tools/nge/elbowNode.jpg" alt="Elbow node"/>
The elbow node is an organizational node to help route wires within a graph. It is a passthrough node that supports Float, Int, Vector2, Vector3, Vector4, Matrix, and Geometry types. The use for this node is just to re-route wires to help with graph organization and it adds no time to the graph calculations so many can be used with no sacrifice to performance. Elbow nodes can be used sequentially as well to perform multiple bends in a wire to detour around congested areas of the graph. Like any other node, an elbow also supports multiple connections to its output port so it can be used to split one wire into many when needed.

#### Debug Infos
- **Call count** shows the number of times this node is called by nodes further into the graph. This is the total number of calls from all subsequent nodes. 
- **Execution count** shows the number of times this node is executed. This value will affect the performance of the graph. Depending on the value of *Evaluate context* on nodes further in the graph the values for *Execution count* may be lower than the value for *Call count*. 

#### Inputs
- **input** can be connected to a node providing a Float, Int, Vector2, Vector3, Vector4, Matrix, or Geometry type.

#### Outputs
- **output** is a passthrough of the value connected to input of the same type.

<H3Image title="GeometryInfo" image="/img/tools/nge/geometryInfoNode.jpg" alt="Geometry info node"/>
This node is also a passthrough node for the Geometry type which adds no time to a graph. It does perform one important task which is supplying access to information about the associated geometry at this specific point of the graph. There may be need to access information like vertex count for debugging purposes which can be fed directly to a debug node. Alternatively, the collectionID of the geometry might be needed to help drive logic in the graph through nodes like equal. This node is flexible enough to fit many different needs which is why it has been added to this group.

#### Debug Infos
Note that call count and execution count appear five times on this node, once for each of the five outputs on this node.
- **Call count** shows the number of times this node is called by nodes further into the graph. This is the total number of calls from all subsequent nodes. 
- **Execution count** shows the number of times this node is executed. This value will affect the performance of the graph. Depending on the value of *Evaluate context* on nodes further in the graph the values for *Execution count* may be lower than the value for *Call count*. 

#### Inputs
- **input** can be connected to a node providing a Geometry type.

#### Outputs
- **output** is a passthrough of the Geometry type connected to input.
- **id** is an Int representing the ID of the current Geometry.
- **collectionID** is an Int representing the ID assigned to this Geometry by a collection to which it is assigned.
- **verticesCount** is an Int representing the total number of vertices in this Geometry.
- **facesCount** is an Int representing the total number of faces in this Geometry.

<H3Image title="Interceptor" image="/img/tools/nge/interceptor.jpg" alt="Interceptor node"/>
The Interceptor node can very simply be thought of as a "code insertion" point. With this node, it is very easy to create a Node Geometry tree, and add custom code where the intercetpor node is added into the tree. This allows you to easily customize and modify your existing Node Geometry Tree with just about anything you could imagine wanting to do. 

See this playground example to see it in action: <Playground id="#QGTNH5" title="Interceptor Example" description="Simple example of the Interceptor Node."/>

#### Debug Infos
- **Call count** shows the number of times this node is called by nodes further into the graph. This is the total number of calls from all subsequent nodes. 
- **Execution count** shows the number of times this node is executed. This value will affect the performance of the graph. Depending on the value of *Evaluate context* on nodes further in the graph the values for *Execution count* may be lower than the value for *Call count*. 

#### Inputs
- **input** can be connected to a node providing any type of input

#### Outputs
- **output** is a passthrough of the value connected to input of the same type. 

<H3Image title="TeleportIn" image="/img/tools/nge/teleportInNode.jpg" alt="Teleport in node"/>
This node is an organizational node to help reduce the complexity of overlapping wires within a graph. It is a passthrough node that supports all data types. This node works in conjunction with the TeleportOut node to make a connection, often far across a graph, without the need for a wire. This node can be connected to any node to create a reference to the value passed by the connected node. When connecting the TeleportIn node to another node, it is important to rename this node to a unique name as this name will be referenced by the TeleportOut node. On the TeleportOut node, selecting the name used by this node as the entry point will create a reference to the value connected to the TeleportIn node. In this way, a single value can be used in several places of a graph without the need to stretch wires across the graph.

#### Inputs
- **input** can be connected to a node providing a Float, Int, Vector2, Vector3, Vector4, Matrix, or Geometry type.

<H3Image title="TeleportOut" image="/img/tools/nge/teleportOutNode.jpg" alt="Teleport out node"/>
This node is an organizational node to help reduce the complexity of overlapping wires within a graph. It is a passthrough node that supports Float, Int, Vector2, Vector3, Vector4, Matrix, and Geometry types. This node works in conjunction with the TeleportIn node to make a connection, often far across a graph, without the need for a wire. Setting the entry point property on this node will tell the node which value to reference. Each TeleportIn node in the graph will be available to the TeleportOut node and it can be changed just by selecting a new entry point if needed. In this way, a single value can be used in several places of a graph without the need to stretch wires across the graph.

#### Debug Infos
- **Call count** shows the number of times this node is called by nodes further into the graph. This is the total number of calls from all subsequent nodes.

#### Outputs
- **output** is the value referenced by the selected entry point in a type that matches the referenced value.

## Updates
These nodes will update connected geometry in one of several ways. It could be assigning it to a collection, merging with other geometry, or setting one of the various properties of geometry like colors, material IDs, normals, positions, tangents, or UVs. These nodes, like the math nodes, are some of the most commonly used nodes as they perform very important operations for creating geometry.

<H3Image title="Aggregator" image="/img/tools/nge/aggregator.jpg" alt="Aggregator node"/>
This node parses through provided data to provide the min, max, or sum of the data provided. It most commonly works when provided geometry and a subset of the positional data of the vertices of that geometry. 

In the example below, the desired outcome is to place a plane on a box, at the exact position of the second to last edge in Y from the top. No matter how many subdivisions the cube has, the plane will always appear at the second to last edge in the Y direction from the top.

<NGE id="#W1WROK" title="Aggregator Example" description="Simple example of the Aggregator Node."/>

It essentially works with these high level steps:

1 - Create the box
2 - Create the plane
3 - Rotate the plane so it's facing down
4 - Find the minimum Y value of the bounding box of the Box geometry
5 - Find all Y positions of the Box geometry that are greater than the result of step 4
6 - Any Y position NOT greater than the result of step 4, set to a value of 1.
7 - Pass all Y positions into the Aggregator node and output the minimum value
8 - Set the plane's y positions equal to the output of step 5

Try adjusting the Int slider being passed to the subdivisionsY value of the Box node. You should see the plane automatically set to the second to last edge (from the top), no matter how many subdivisions you have in the box.

#### Debug Infos
- **Call count** shows the number of times this node is called by nodes further into the graph. This is the total number of calls from all subsequent nodes. 
- **Execution count** shows the number of times this node is executed. This value will affect the performance of the graph. Depending on the value of *Evaluate context* on nodes further in the graph the values for *Execution count* may be lower than the value for *Call count*. 

#### Advanced
- **Evaluate context** determines whether any nodes connected after this one can instruct this node to evaluate its context again. There are two considerations to keep in mind here. The first is the importance of this node delivering the same data to each connected node and the second is how much extra processing time is needed to evaluate context again. If it is important that this node return the same data for each connected node, set **Evaluate context** to false or any procedurally generated data feeding this node will generate new data for each connected node. If generating a new data set for each connected node is desirable, set this property to true. This also applies to nodes that loop which will request a new evaluation of the context for each iteration of the loop if this property is set to true. If there are no procedural nodes feeding this one or all procedural nodes are locked, disable this property to optimize build time. There is no reason to evaluate the context if the data feeding this node does not change. As the graph gets more complex and looping nodes nest it quickly becomes apparent that disabling **Evaluate context** improves performance and is recommended where possible.
- **Operation** determines the mathematical operation to set on the input positional values (min, max, sum)

#### Inputs
- **geometry** is connected to a node providing a Geometry type.
- **source** float positional values.

#### Outputs
- **output** is the resulting float from the aggregator operation (min, max, sum)

<H3Image title="Boolean" image="/img/tools/nge/boolean.jpg" alt="Boolean node"/>
This node will create a new mesh from the intersection of the two meshes connected to the inputs depending on the operation chosen. Note that this operation works best when both geometry inputs have a moderately high and relatively similar subdivision count. If the two geometry inputs have low resolution or big differences between them in resolution the resulting mesh can be poorly triangulated. The result of the boolean operation will be a newly constructed triangle list removing any vertices that are eliminated by the chosen operation. Because this is a newly generated mesh, previous mesh attributes like UVs will be removed and need to be authored for this new mesh. 

#### Debug Infos
- **Call count** shows the number of times this node is called by nodes further into the graph. This is the total number of calls from all subsequent nodes. 
- **Execution count** shows the number of times this node is executed. This value will affect the performance of the graph. Depending on the value of *Evaluate context* on nodes further in the graph the values for *Execution count* may be lower than the value for *Call count*.

As the graph gets more complex and looping nodes nest it quickly becomes apparent that disabling **Evaluate context** improves performance and is recommended where possible.
- **Operation** determines the boolean operation to apply to the input meshes. Intersect will create a mesh consisting of the intersection between the two input meshes. Subtract will create a mesh that is the result of subtracting geometry0 from geometry1. Union creates a mesh that is the union of the two input meshes and eliminates any vertices that vall completely inside the union.

#### Inputs
- **geometry0** the first input of Geometry type to be used in the boolean operation.
- **geometry1** the second input of Geometry type to be used in the boolean operation.

#### Outputs
- **output** is the resulting mesh from the boolean operation.

<H3Image title="CleanGeometry" image="/img/tools/nge/cleanGeometry.jpg" alt="Clean Geometry Node"/>
It is possible to end up with geometry where the faces are inverted from what the user expects to see, even after using the "Compute Normals" node. The Clean Geometry node attempts to resolve this by recalculating the normal direction of surfaces. 

#### Debug Infos

<H3Image title="Collection" image="/img/tools/nge/collectionNode.jpg" alt="Collection node"/>
This node creates a collection of up to 10 geometry inputs. When used in conjunction with one of the instantiate nodes, the collection will provide one random geometry from the collection per iteration of the instantiate node. This allows for more randomization when creating a procedural mesh. The collection also provides a unique collection ID to each included geometry to help drive logic within the graph. The collection ID can be accessed with the GeometryInfo node.

<H3Image title="Lattice" image="/img/tools/nge/lattice.jpg" alt="Lattice Node"/>
The lattice places a simplified "cage" over your geometry, allowing you to manipulate the geometry from a higher more simplified level. This is similar in concept to how subdivisional surfaces work, where a complex mesh is derived from a more simplified mesh. The lattice tool is a handy way to make larger manipulations to an already detailed piece of geometry.

There are a couple of special things to note about the lattice node. In the 3D example below, the white cone represents the geometry passed to the lattice node and the wireframe box represents the lattice cage placed around the geometry. The lattice cage is automatically mapped to the bounding box of the geometry that's connected to it. Each manipulation point of the lattice is known as a "Lattice ID." Much like vertices, these Lattice ID's are each represented by a Vector3. In the case of the 3D example below, the resolutionX, resolutionY, and resolutionZ are all set to 3 and you can see the Vector3 ID of each point on the lattice cage. Note that the lattice ID of (0,0,0) is always mapped to the lowest x,y,z point of the bounding box surrounding the geometry. 

<CodePen pen="WbNXYpw" tab="result" title="Lattice Visualization" />

Manipulating the lattice IDs is very similar to how you modify vertices in the Node Geometry Editor. Have a look at this example: <NGE id="#FF8N3Q#5" title="Lattice Example" description="Simple example of the Lattice Node."/>

<img src="/img/tools/nge/latticeExample1.jpg" title="LatticeExample1"/>

You start by connecting geometry to the input port of the Lattice node and connect the output geometry port of the lattice node to the Geometry Output node. This step creates the "cage" around the input cylinder.

<img src="/img/tools/nge/latticeExample2.jpg" title="LatticeExample2"/>

Next, you specify the lattice IDs of the cage that you'd like to manipulate. In the case of the image above, we are targeting any lattice ID that has the same y value as defined by an input slider. Note the use of the Lattice ID node here.

<img src="/img/tools/nge/latticeExample3.jpg" title="LatticeExample3"/>

Lastly, manipulating the Lattice Control values will apply the modification to the Lattice. In the case above, the Lattice Control node is passed to the Equal node's ifFalse port. This means that when the Y value of a Lattice ID is NOT equal to the slider, don't do anything. Or in more simple terms, apply nothing. In the case of the evaluation being "True" we modify the Lattice Control, multiplying the X and Z values by 1.5. 

When you adjust the 'LatticeYInfluence' Slider, you'll see different parts of the cone geometry expand by 1.5 in the X and Z directions. 

Finally, to fully get a sense of what the lattice node can do, try adjusting a few things. Try increasing the subdivisions of the Cylinder geometry. After playing with the 'LatticeYInfluence' slider again, you'll notice the geometry change differently. And finally, try increasing the resolution of the Lattice Cage in the Lattice node. Again you see different results. 

The Lattice tool is incredibly powerful for making large sweeping modifications to otherwise very detailed geometry!

#### Debug Infos
- **Call count** shows the number of times this node is called by nodes further into the graph. This is the total number of calls from all subsequent nodes. 
- **Execution count** shows the number of times this node is executed. This value will affect the performance of the graph. Depending on the value of *Evaluate context* on nodes further in the graph the values for *Execution count* may be lower than the value for *Call count*. 

#### Inputs
- **geometry** is connected to a node providing a Geometry type.
- **controls** is connected to Vector3 data, ideally provided by modified data coming from the output of the Lattice Control node.

#### Outputs
- **output** is the geometry after computing normals.

<H3Image title="Mapping" image="/img/tools/nge/mappingNode.jpg" alt="Mapping node"/>
When working with geometry, it is often necessary to create a new UV mapping for it such as when the geometry has been optimized or if an additional UV set is desired. This node will create new set of UV coordinates for the geometry based on the projection method selected. The available projections are spherical, cylindrical, and cubic and more may be added in the future. Simply pass the positions contextual value to the position input and a Vector3 to the center input to define the center of the projection and create UV coordinates for each vertex.

#### Properties
- **center** is a Vector3 that defines the center of the projection mapping. This allows for a more precise mapping by allowing the projection shape to be moved to encompass the mesh in the way that will best unwrap the mesh.

#### Debug Infos
- **Call count** shows the number of times this node is called by nodes further into the graph. This is the total number of calls from all subsequent nodes. 
- **Execution count** shows the number of times this node is executed. This value will affect the performance of the graph. Depending on the value of *Evaluate context* on nodes further in the graph the values for *Execution count* may be lower than the value for *Call count*. 

#### Advanced
- **Mapping** defines the projection method for mapping UV coordinates from the available options of spherical, cylindrical, and cubic.

#### Inputs
- **position** is connected to the positions contextual value node to provide the vertex list to the node.
- **normal** is connected to the normals contextual value node to provide the vertex normals to the node.
- **center** is connected to a node a Vector3 position for the center of the projection. This allows for a more precise mapping by allowing the projection shape to be moved to encompass the mesh in the way that will best unwrap the mesh.

#### Outputs
- **uv** is the UV set generated for the mesh. This output would be connected to a SetUVs node to apply the UV set to the geometry.

<H3Image title="Merge" image="/img/tools/nge/mergeNode.jpg" alt="Merge node"/>
A common operation when creating procedural geometry is to merge two or more different meshes. This node will merge up to five geometry inputs into one using a simple merge. This node does not do any type of boolean operation and does not change the vertex lists or UV coordinates at all. If multiple meshes are merged which have different material IDs, a MultiMaterial will be created and assigned to keep the original material breaks of each geometry. When using the Merge node, please note that the advanced property Evaluate Context is disabled by default for performance reasons. If the prior context is not evaluated then any procedural generation of values done before the merge node will be executed only once. If the output of that merge node is then used in any instantiate loop, all instances will be exactly the same. If it is desired that merged geometry built procedurally be unique with each instance, the Evaluate Context property on the Merge node must be enabled. Remember that enabling Evaluate Context on a merge node will increase the time needed to generate the final geometry, so it is important to be prudent on how many nodes must be evaluated before merging, especially if the output of the merge is then used as the source for instancing. 

#### Debug Infos
- **Call count** shows the number of times this node is called by nodes further into the graph. This is the total number of calls from all subsequent nodes. 
- **Execution count** shows the number of times this node is executed. This value will affect the performance of the graph. Depending on the value of *Evaluate context* on nodes further in the graph the values for *Execution count* may be lower than the value for *Call count*. 

#### Advanced
- **Evaluate context** determines whether any nodes connected after this one can instruct this node to evaluate its context again. There are two considerations to keep in mind here. The first is the importance of this node delivering the same data to each connected node and the second is how much extra processing time is needed to evaluate context again. If it is important that this node return the same data for each connected node, set **Evaluate context** to false or any procedurally generated data feeding this node will generate new data for each connected node. If generating a new data set for each connected node is desirable, set this property to true. This also applies to nodes that loop which will request a new evaluation of the context for each iteration of the loop if this property is set to true. If there are no procedural nodes feeding this one or all procedural nodes are locked, disable this property to optimize build time. There is no reason to evaluate the context if the data feeding this node does not change. As the graph gets more complex and looping nodes nest it quickly becomes apparent that disabling **Evaluate context** improves performance and is recommended where possible.

<H3Image title="Optimize" image="/img/tools/nge/optimizeNode.jpg" alt="Optimize node"/>
There are times when a geometry will have unwelded vertices where multiple vertices occupy the same position. This is common when using glTF files as the specification states that vertices that lie on a UV seam should be split for optimization reasons. If working with geometry that has unwelded vertices that need to be merged, use the optimize node. This node does a simple operation that merges any vertices that share the same position within a certain epsilon. This operation is destructive in that it creates a new triangle list and deletes all vertex parameters other than positions. This means that any mesh that has been optimized will need new normals, tangents, and vertex colors. Typically, the first node connected after an Optimize node would be a ComputeNormals node.

- **scale** is an input field for a Float value to be used to scale the noise texture. This property is only visible if there is no wire connected to the rotation input.
- **octaves** is an input field for a Float value to be used to adjust the number of octaves to the noise texture which increases the frequency of the pattern resulting in increased detail in the texture. This property is only visible if there is no wire connected to the scaling input.
- **roughness** is an input field for a Float value to be used to adjust the amplitude of the octaves in the noise texture which adds contrast to the texture. This property is only visible if there is no wire connected to the scaling input.

#### Debug Infos
- **Call count** shows the number of times this node is called by nodes further into the graph. This is the total number of calls from all subsequent nodes.

<H3Image title="Random" image="/img/tools/nge/randomNode.jpg" alt="Random node"/>
This node provides a random value between a minimum value and a maximum value. This node can support Float, Int, Vector2, Vector3, and Vector4 types. The type for the node connected to the input of this node determines the type for the node output. When using this node with iterable nodes, the node will return a new random value per iteration. Iterable nodes include SetColors, SetNormals, SetPositions, SetTangents, and SetUVs as the operations are performed for every vertex in the geometry. If a random node is used before one of these iterable nodes, a new random value will be generated for each iteration. This is also true for all of the instantiate nodes where the node will loop a certain number of times based on inputs. For more control, the Random node also has an advanced property to lock the value per loop so that the random value will be the same for each iteration or loop. Note that this property only applies to the nearest iteration or loop being performed by a node. This means if a Random node feeds a SetColor node which in turn feeds an Instantiate node, locking the value per loop will apply only to the SetColor node and not the Instantiate node.

## Textures
Texture data can be loaded and cached to be made available to the graph. Texture data can be used for operations like instantiating meshes based on texture values at a given UV coordinate or for assigning vertex color to a mesh. Using textures in the graph require both a Texture node and a Texture Fetch node. The Texture node takes care of the loading and caching of the Texture data while the Texture Fetch takes care of returning specific Texture data based on UV coordinate. Unlike Texture nodes in the Node Material Editor, Texture data is not rendered on the mesh directly but instead used for driving instantiation or setting mesh properties.
