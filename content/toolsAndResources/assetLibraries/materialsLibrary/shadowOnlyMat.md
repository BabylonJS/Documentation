## General

![Screenshot](/img/extensions/materials/shadowOnly.jpg)

The goal of the ShadowOnlyMaterial is to display only shadows casted by a light on a receiving object. It is mostly useful when you want to display shadow on a transparent canvas (on top of your existing DOM).

ShadowOnly material can be found here: [https://cdn.babylonjs.com/materialsLibrary/babylon.shadowOnlyMaterial.js](https://cdn.babylonjs.com/materialsLibrary/babylon.shadowOnlyMaterial.js)

A demo can be found here: PG: <Playground id="#1KF7V1" title="Shadow Only Material" description="Example of shadow only material"/>

## Using the ShadowOnly material

ShadowOnly material is dead simple to use. Just apply it as material to any mesh where you want to display only shadow:

```
var ground = BABYLON.Mesh.CreatePlane('ground', 1000, scene)
ground.rotation.x = Math.PI / 2
ground.material = new BABYLON.ShadowOnlyMaterial('shadowOnly', scene)
ground.receiveShadows = true
```

By default the shadow color is black but you can force an artificial color with `material.shadowColor = BABYLON.Color3.Red()`.

**Limitation:** Please note that only the first light that can reach the mesh will be used.
So if you have multiple lights in your scene you may end up using `light.includedOnlyMeshes` or `light.excludedMeshes` or `light.includeOnlyWithLayerMask` or `light.excludeWithLayerMask`.
You can also force the material to pick a specific light with `material.activeLight = light`.
