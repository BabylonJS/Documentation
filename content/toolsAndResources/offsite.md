# Babylon.js Off-Site Tutorials and Documents

## Introduction

Throughout the history of Babylon.js, coders and authors have written tutorials and documentation which is stored in places other than at our primary documentation site.

In this document, we will attempt to provide links-to and information-about those off-site documents.

Anyone who wrote a tutorial is welcome on this page, do not hesitate to [PR in Github](https://github.com/BabylonJS/Documentation/blob/master/content/resources/Reference/offsite_tutorials_list.md) or notify relevant links through [forum](https://forum.babylonjs.com/) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/babylonjs) for example.

In this splendid tutorial, Temechon uses the handy Babylon VertexData object, along with blank/updatable mesh... to make lightweight trees.                                                                                                    |

Temechon succeeds in removing those struggles... with this comprehensive tutorial about contributing to Babylon.js.                                                                                                             |

In this cool tutorial, Temechon uses it within a complete webGL game. Two How_To in one!                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| [ **Old School Oimo Physics** ](http://www.pixelcodr.com/tutos/oimo/oimo.html)                   |                   Physics, Oimo, Impostor                    | Temechon coded much of the original physics "plugins", interfacing third-party physics engines... to Babylon.js. Later, version 2 of the plugins was developed by Raanan Weber (see below), but Raanan ensured that v2 plugins were backwards-compatible with original v1 plugins. So, this older Oimo-based physics tutorial is still quite pertinent. Its code examples still work great.   |
| [ **More Oimo - Impulses & Velocities** ](http://www.pixelcodr.com/tutos/physics/physics.html)   | Physics, Oimo, AngularVelocity, LinearVelocity, ApplyImpulse | In this slightly-advanced Oimo physics tutorial, Temechon shows us how to "force the issue"... adding energy and direction to Oimo's physics impostors. This tutorial is based-upon the v1 Oimo plugin, but again, due to backwards-compatibility, all code examples work fine with the v2 plugins, as well. It's all good!                                                                   |
| [ **First Person Shooter Prototype** ](http://www.pixelcodr.com/tutos/shooter/shooter.html)      |    OOP, Project, Asset, LayerMask, Viewport, PointerLock     | The first-person shooter (FPS) game is one of the most enjoyable and popular game-types in 3D land. In this gorgeous tutorial, Julian takes us end-to-end through the development process. As with all of Julian's games and How_To, he uses Object Oriented Programming (OOP) techniques, which result in re-usable pieces. These OOP pieces streamline work-flow for future games/projects. |

As you can see, Temechon is a prolific game-author, both 2D and 3D. And we know why he is able to produce game after game, quickly and easily, right? Yep, OOP... reusable code... he does it well. Borrow his techniques, and you borrow great wisdom.                                              |
