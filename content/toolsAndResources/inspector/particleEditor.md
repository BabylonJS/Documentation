## Creating Particles The Easy Way

Babylon.js has a feature-rich, powerful particle system. Babylon.js 4.2 introduced a new tool to make it simple and easy to leverage this powerful system. The Babylon.js Particle Editor. Built right into [The Inspector](/legacy/inspector), creating particle systems is now as easy as right-clicking! From there you can save your particle system to a [snippet server for load](/features/featuresDeepDive/particles/particle_system/particle_snippets) or you can save your file to be [loaded from a local json file](/features/featuresDeepDive/particles/particle_system/particles_loadFromFile).
