This texture has 4 parameters :
- **numberOfBricksHeight** controls the number of bricks in height (Int)
- **numberOfBricksWidth** controls the number of bricks in width (Int)
- **jointColor** changes the color for the joint between bricks (BABYLON.Color3/4)
- **brickColor** changes the color for the brick itself (BABYLON.Color3/4)

```javascript
var brickMaterial = new BABYLON.StandardMaterial("brickMat", scene);
var brickTexture = new BABYLON.BrickProceduralTexture("brickTex", 512, scene);
brickTexture.numberOfBricksHeight = 6;
brickTexture.numberOfBricksWidth = 10;
brickMaterial.diffuseTexture = brickTexture;
```
