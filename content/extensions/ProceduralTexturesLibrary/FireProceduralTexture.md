- Minified : [Minified](https://cdn.babylonjs.com/proceduralTexturesLibrary/babylon.fireProceduralTexture.min.js)

A demo can be found here:  <Playground id="#KM3TC" title="Fire Procedural Texture" description="Fire Procedural Texture"/>

This texture has 4 parameters :
- **time** can be set manually(float) if autoGenerateTime(boolean) is set to false. It is used inside the fire shader to animate it
- **speed** controls the speed of the flames (BABYLON.Vector2)
- **shift** controls the direction of the flames (BABYLON.Vector2)
- **fireColors** is an array of 6 (BABYLON.Color3/4) defining the different color of the fire. You can define them manually of use presets available as static properties of the class (PurpleFireColors, GreenFireColors, RedFireColors, BlueFireColors)

```javascript
var fireMaterial = new BABYLON.StandardMaterial("fireMat", scene);
var fireTexture = new BABYLON.FireProceduralTexture("fireTex", 256, scene);
fireMaterial.diffuseTexture = fireTexture;
fireMaterial.opacityTexture = fireTexture;
```
