This texture has 4 parameters :
- **numberOfTilesHeight** controls the number of tiles in height (Int)
- **numberOfTilesWidth** controls the number of tiles in width (Int)
- **jointColor** changes the color for the joint between tiles (BABYLON.Color3/4)
- **marbleColor** changes the color for the tile itself (BABYLON.Color3/4)

```javascript
var marbleMaterial = new BABYLON.StandardMaterial("marbleMat", scene);
var marbleTexture = new BABYLON.MarbleProceduralTexture("marbleTex", 512, scene);
marbleTexture.numberOfTilesHeight = 5;
marbleTexture.numberOfTilesWidth = 5;
marbleMaterial.ambientTexture = marbleTexture;
```
