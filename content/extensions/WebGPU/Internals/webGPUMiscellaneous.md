## Validation tests
These validation tests are excluded from WebGPU because some features are not implemented in Babylon.js yet:
* **GLTF Mesh Primitive Mode (0)** and **GLTF Mesh Primitive Mode (1)**: line loop / triangle fan not implemented yet
* **GLTF Buggy with Meshopt Compression**: formats others than `float` for the vertex buffers (*position*, *normal*, *uv*, ...) are not supported yet

When the features are implemented, the corresponding validation tests should be re-enabled.

The **Self shadowing** validation test generates rendering errors (but is still ok because there are less than 2.5% errors) because it uses exponential shadow map whose parameters (`depthScale` especially) depend on the precision of the depth map. In WebGL we are using a 32 bits float texture but in WebGPU it's only a half-float texture because linear filtering of 32 bits float textures are not supported (for the time being at least):

**Note to core developers: YOU SHOULD RUN THE VALIDATION TESTS LOCALLY OFTEN BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT RUN ON THE AZURE SERVERS!**

Run both the:
* WebGPU tests: http://localhost:1338/tests/validation/?list=webgpu&engine=webgpu
* Standard tests: http://localhost:1338/tests/validation/?list=config&engine=webgpu

You should also run them in the "check resource creation" mode: see [Check Resource Creation - WebGPU only
](/workflow/wfDeeper/developWithBjs/howToStart/validationTests#check-resource-creation---webgpu-only).

## TintWASM
You should update the **TWGSL** (Tint WASM) module regularly so that it stays in sync with the **Tint** source code.
