## TextureCanvas

![Fur material high](/img/extensions/texturecanvas.jpg)

## About

TextureCanvas is a texture on which other textures can be drawn.

## Usage

## Creating a canvas

To construct a TextureCanvas, you need to provide the size and the scene the texture will be used in:

```javascript
// A square texture
let canvas = new TextureCanvas(128, scene);
```

```javascript
// A rectangular texture
let canvas = new TextureCanvas({ width: 256, height: 128 }, scene);
```

Aditionally, you may pass three more parameters, which are:

-   _initTexture_, an initial texture to draw.
-   _onReady_, a function to be called when the canvas is ready.
-   _options_, an object with the properties _generateMipMaps_ (boolean) and _samplingMode_ (number)

## Draw using contexts

Contexts can be used to specify how a texture should be drawn. Multiple contexts can be created and used interchangably.

To draw a texture using the default context, you can call `canvas.drawTexture(myTexture)`.

You can create a context like this:

```javascript
let ctx = canvas.createContext();
```

A context has the following propteries:

| Name                    | Type                                                                                                                | Description                                                                                               |

Once the context is set up, simply call `ctx.draw()` or `ctx.drawTexture(myTexture)`

## Notes

Please note that uv-coordinates are used rather than pixel values.

## Rotation

Rotating a texture happens in three dimensions in the default coordinate system of Babylon.js, with _z_ being the forward axis.

You can set a pivot point to be in local space (that of the diffuse texture), or world space (that of the canvas), with `pivotPoint.isLocalSpace`.
