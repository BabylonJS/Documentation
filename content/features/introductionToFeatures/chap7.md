## Lighting the Village

Perpetual light in the village can make sleeping very difficult so we will introduce night time by turning the lights down. Of course people do not want to walk in total darkness at night so we will add some street lights. Since perpetual night is no better than perpetual day we will add an interface to change from one to the other. We want to turn the light down at night and bring it up during the day. Let's add a GUI control to do this. Also where there is light there are shadows and Babylon.js can add them as well.
