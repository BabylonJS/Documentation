# Getting Started - Mesh Parents

## Parents and Children

We are going to add a very simple car that moves through the village. 

No matter how simple a car needs wheels and we have to combine the body of the car and the wheels.

Using merge meshes to combine them would result in the wheels not being able to rotate. Instead we set the body of the car as a parent of each wheel.

Before building our simple car let's take a way to set a parent and what this means.

```javascript
meshChild.parent = meshParent
```

Any use of position, scaling and rotation on the parent will also be applied to the child. Setting the position of the child is done in the parent space, setting the rotation and scale of the child takes place in the child's local space.

You can vary the values in the following playground to see the effect on the parent and child.

Now we are ready to build the car and afterwards to animate it.
