# Getting Started - Car Animation

## Animate the Car in the Village

In a similar way to how we animated the wheels we now animate the car to travel a straight line over 5 secs., stop for 2 secs. and then repeat.
```javascript
const animCar = new BABYLON.Animation("carAnimation", "position.x", 30, BABYLON.Animation.ANIMATIONTYPE_FLOAT, BABYLON.Animation.ANIMATIONLOOPMODE_CYCLE);

const carKeys = []; 

carKeys.push({
    frame: 0,
    value: -4
});

carKeys.push({
    frame: 150,
    value: 4
});

carKeys.push({
    frame: 210,
    value: 4
});

animCar.setKeys(carKeys);

car.animations = [];
car.animations.push(animCar);

scene.beginAnimation(car, 0, 210, true);
```

After adjusting the position of the car and its route so that it travels past the village houses we have

In this case we have built the car. Let's now look at a model character that we can import along with its built-in animation.
