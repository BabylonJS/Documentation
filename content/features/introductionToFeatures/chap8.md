## Different Points of View

So far we have only viewed the village from a distant point like a spy in the sky. Our final steps are to get a bit closer in. We attach a camera behind our character to get an over the shoulder view of the village, having a look around as he walks. We can also change cameras and follow him like a target of a spy drone. The very last thing is to show you that Babylon.js can use modern 3D viewers to give a complete 3D view of our world.
