## Different Materials

The SPS renders all the particles in a single draw call because you've used only one material, or none what means a default material under the hood, so far.  
Sometimes yet, you may want to use several materials in order to render some glowing particles with the glow layer, some others with a bump texture and some others with a colored standard material for instance. In this case, you may accept that the draw call number is higher but you wish it keeps at its possible minimum.  
The SPS supports the MultiMaterials and provides a mechanism to keep the draw call number to a minimum value. You can use them by different ways.

### Simple way

The simplest way to set different materials to the particles is to set a different material to each model used to create the particles and to ask the SPS to use these materials at construction time with the optional paramater `useModelMaterial` set to `true` (default `false`).

```javascript
// model1, model2 and model3 are meshes with already set materials at this step
var sps = new BABYLON.SolidParticleSystem("sps", scene, {
  useModelMaterial: true,
});
sps.addShape(model1, 300);
sps.addShape(model2, 300);
sps.addShape(model3, 300);
sps.buildMesh();
```

This enables the multimaterial support, then copies the model geometries and creates automatically the SPS multimaterial from the model materials, with the following rule :

- if several models share the same material, this material is used only once in the SPS : particles are sorted in this purpose to minimize the draw call numbers,
- if a model has no material, a standard material is created,
- if another following model has also no material, the first rule applies : the newly created standard material is shared among the particles depicting all the models with no material.  
  Example: <Playground id="#RCUHJA" title="Materials In SPS" description="Simple example of applying materials to solid particles."/>

You can obviously notice that this method associates the model materials to the particles on the particle shape basis : all the particles of a given shape share the same material.  
You can still change this behavior by assignig some materials on the particle basis by setting the particle property `.materialIndex` value to the wanted material index. The material index is simply the index of the shape material in the order the shape are created : 0 for the first shape, 1 for the second one, and so on. If set, it overwrites the assigned shape material index.  
This can be done at creation time in a `positionFunction` of an immutable SPS for instance.

```javascript
var initParticle = function (particle, i) {
  particle.position.x = areaSize * (Math.random() - 0.5);
  particle.position.y = areaSize * (Math.random() - 0.5);
  particle.position.z = areaSize * (Math.random() - 0.5);
  // above a given altitude, it's given the material 1
  // whatever the initial shape material
  if (particle.position.y > areaSize * 0.1) {
    particle.materialIndex = 1;
  }
};
var sps = new BABYLON.SolidParticleSystem("sps", scene, {
  useModelMaterial: true,
  updatable: false,
});
sps.addShape(model1, 300, { positionFunction: initFunction });
sps.addShape(model2, 300, { positionFunction: initFunction });
sps.addShape(model3, 300, { positionFunction: initFunction });
sps.buildMesh();
```

Example: <Playground id="#RCUHJA#2" title="Solid Particle Material Assignment" description="Simple example of assigning materials to solid particles."/>

This method can be used to build non-updatable meshes with MultiMaterials by assembling shapes of different materials even when knowing nothing about indices nor vertices as it's required to define a MultiMaterial object by hands : https://doc.babylonjs.com/how_to/multi_materials

### Intermediate way

When you set the SPS `useModelMaterial` property to `true`, this enables the support for MultiMaterial.  
You can also enable this support by just setting the property `enableMultiMaterial` to `true`.  
In this case, the difference is that the support is enabled but the model materials aren't copied at construction time.

You may want then to use your own set of materials instead of the model ones.
So, whatever the SPS is immutable or not and whatever you're using `enableMultiMaterial` or `useModelMaterial`, you can pass your own materials to the SPS once it's build with the method `sps.setMultiMaterials(arrayOfMaterials)`.

```javascript
var sps = new BABYLON.SolidParticleSystem("sps", scene, {
  enableMultiMaterial: true,
  updatable: false,
});
sps.addShape(model1, 300, { positionFunction: initFunction });
sps.addShape(model2, 300, { positionFunction: initFunction });
sps.addShape(model3, 300, { positionFunction: initFunction });
sps.buildMesh();

// mat0, mat1, mat2 are Material objects
sps.setMultiMaterial([mat0, mat1, mat2]);

// ... later in the code, swap mat0 and mat1
sps.setMultiMaterial([mat1, mat0, mat2]);
```

This method can be called as many times as needed once the SPS mesh is built.  
It recomputes the underlying MultiMaterial object and the SPS geometry in order to group the particles by materials, so it's probably not a good idea to call it each frame in the render loop.  
Example: <Playground id="#RCUHJA#3" title="Intermediate Solid Particle Material Assignment" description="Intermediate example of assigning materials to solid particles."/>

### Advanced way

Until now, you've essentially set the particle `materialIndex` values at construction time and they haven't changed then, only the materials themselves have changed.  
You can still change the particle `materialIndex` values at any time, for instance in a call to `sps.updateParticle()` from `sps.setParticles()` like you would do to change the particle positions or rotations, or in a call to any other function of your own at some moment.  
The difference with the other particle properties (positon, rotation, etc) is that `setParticles()` doesn't compute the materials at all.  
Indeed `setParticles()` is designed to be called each frame in the render loop and to make sure to keep the garbage collector activity to its minimum by allocating nothing.  
Applying the changes of `materialIndex` values requires to sort again all the particles, to recompute the whole SPS geometry and moreover to recreate new SubMesh objects from the SPS mesh.  
Therefore a dedicated method is provided `sps.computeSubMeshes()`. This method is to be called manually after each change of particle `materialIndex` values for them to be taken in account at once.  
Like `setMultiMaterials()`, it's probably not a good idea to call it each frame in the render loop.

```javascript
// updatable SPS creation
var sps = new BABYLON.SolidParticleSystem("sps", scene, {
  enableMultiMaterial: true,
});
sps.addShape(model1, 300);
sps.addShape(model2, 300);
sps.addShape(model3, 300);
sps.buildMesh();

// mat0, mat1, mat2 are Material objects
sps.setMultiMaterial([mat0, mat1, mat2]);

// the particle materialIndex are set in the call to updateParticle
// while the mesh and the multimaterial are already built
sps.updateParticle = initFunction;
sps.setParticles(); // updates the particle positions
sps.computeSubMeshes(); // actually computes the submeshes and materials
```

Examples: <Playground id="#RCUHJA#4" title="Advanced Solid Particle Material Assignment 1" description="Advanced example of assigning materials to solid particles."/>
In this second example the particles above a given altitude are given the next material in turn every 15 frames. <Playground id="#RCUHJA#7" title="Advanced Solid Particle Material Assignment 2" description="Advanced example of assigning materials to solid particles where the particles above a given altitude are given the next material in turn every 15 frames."/>

If you still really want to call `computeSubMeshes()` each time you call `setParticles()` because your particle materials are updated at this same frequency, you can then set the property `sps.autoUpdateSubMeshes` to `true` (default `false`). In this case, no more need for calling `sps.computeSubMeshes()` by hands as `setParticles()` will do it for you internally.

```javascript
sps.autoUpdateSubMeshes = true;
sps.setParticles(); // updates the particle material indexes AND recomputes the subMeshes
```

Example: <Playground id="#RCUHJA#8" title="Advanced Solid Particle Material Assignment 3" description="Advanced example of material assignment to solid particles with computeSubMeshes()."/>

In the case you want to make your own MultiMaterial object by hands, then set it to the SPS mesh material property and call `sps.computeSubMeshes()` to internally build the needed SubMesh objects.

```javascript
var multimat = new BABYLON.MultiMaterial("multi", scene);
multimat.subMaterials.push(material0);
multimat.subMaterials.push(material1);
multimat.subMaterials.push(material2);

sps.mesh.material = multimat;
sps.computeSubMeshes();
```

**Note 1 :** By default, the particle `materialIndex` value is `null`.  
When enabling the MultiMaterial in the SPS, this value is set to zero for every particle until it's overwritten by the user or automatically set to some model material index by `useModelMaterial`.  
**Note 2 :** The particle depth sort doesn't work with the MultiMaterial support because particles can't be sorted by their distances to the camera and by materials in the same time. So if you enable both modes, it won't crash but it will get to some weird visible results.  
**Note 3 :** The SPS MultiMaterial support works also with an expandable SPS, meaning you can add/store/remove particles with different materials. When calling `sps.buildMesh()` again, everything is then recomputed automatically.
