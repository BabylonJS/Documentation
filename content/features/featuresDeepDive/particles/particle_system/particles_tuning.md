# Basic Particle Properties

There are a wide range of properties to tune the behavior of the particles in the system including their lifetime, size, color, emission rates, speed, direction of travel, orientation and application of gravity.

On this page we will consider them and how to set a range of values for them. On the next we will show how these settings can be changed either over a particles lifetime or the duration of the system when it is set.

## Size

The size of the particles can be varied randomly within a given range,

```javascript
particleSystem.minSize = 0.1;
particleSystem.maxSize = 0.5;
```

Size range: <Playground id="#0K3AQ2#11" title="Particle Size Range Example" description="Simple example showing how to set a size range for a particle system."/>

## Scale

When you want to change the particle base shape from square to rectangular scale x and y values using

```javascript
particleSystem.minScaleX = 0.1;
particleSystem.maxScaleX = 0.5;

particleSystem.minScaleY = 0.2;
particleSystem.maxScaleY = 0.4;
```

Scale range: <Playground id="#0K3AQ2#12" title="Particle Scale Range Example" description="Simple example showing how to set a scale range for a particle system."/>

## Color

There are three colors that can be set for the particle system, two which are combined (or blended) during the lifetime of the particle and a third that it takes on just before the end of its lifetime.

```javascript
particleSystem.color1 = new BABYLON.Color4(0.7, 0.8, 1.0, 1.0);
particleSystem.color2 = new BABYLON.Color4(0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 1.0);
particleSystem.colorDead = new BABYLON.Color4(0, 0, 0.2, 0.0);
```

Color: <Playground id="#0K3AQ2#21" title="Particle Color Example" description="Simple example showing how to set colors of particles."/>

## Speed

The speed of a particle is governed by the amount of power applied to a particle when emitted. The more power the faster it goes. The emission power, and hence the speed, of the particles can be varied randomly within a given range,

```javascript
particleSystem.minEmitPower = 1;
particleSystem.maxEmitPower = 3;
```

Power range: <Playground id="#0K3AQ2#28" title="Particle Power Range Example" description="Simple example showing how to set a power range for a particle system."/>

## Rotation

You can define a range of angular speeds in radians per second:

```javascript
particleSystem.minAngularSpeed = 0;
particleSystem.maxAngularSpeed = Math.PI;
```

You can also define a particle's initial rotation angle with

```
particleSystem.minInitialRotation = 0;
particleSystem.maxInitialRotation = Math.PI / 2;
```

Rotating: <Playground id="#0K3AQ2#23" title="Rotating Particles" description="Simple example showing how to rotate particles."/>
Rotating with set initial angle: <Playground id="#0K3AQ2#25" title="Rotating Particles With Initial Angle" description="Simple example showing how to rotate particles with an initial angle."/>

## Translation Pivot

By default the center of transformation for a particle is at the middle of its plane. You are able to set it to a different point relative to its middle. To change the pivot position use

```javascript
particleSystem.translationPivot = new BABYLON.Vector2(2, 2); // across and up the containing plane
```

## Direction

Two directions can be specified. If you specify just _direction1_ the particles will travel randomly in the general direction given. When both directions are given the particles will travel in a direction between the two. In practice the vectors act as giving a velocity (direction and speed) to the particles; i.e. particles with direction (10, -10, 10) travel 10 times faster than those with direction (1, -1, 1).

```javascript
particleSystem.direction1 = new BABYLON.Vector3(-7, 8, 3);
particleSystem.direction2 = new BABYLON.Vector3(7, 8, -3);
```

direction range: <Playground id="#0K3AQ2#31" title="Particle Direction Range Example" description="Simple example showing how to set a direction range for a particle system."/>

## Gravity

A value for gravity can be applied as a vector3 in any direction. For example if negative in the Y direction the particles will slowly be pulled downwards.

```javascript
particleSystem.gravity = new BABYLON.Vector3(0, -9.81, 0);
```

Direction and gravity: <Playground id="#0K3AQ2#32" title="Direction And Gravity" description="Simple example showing how to set direction and gravity in a particle system."/>

## Emit Rate

The emit rate determines the number of particles emitted per second. The larger the number the more dense appears the emitted cloud of particles. As particles die they are recycled to be emitted again. If their lifetime is long enough and their emission rate fast enough it is possible for there to be a gap in the emission of particles.

![emitRate](/img/how_to/Particles/12-3.png)

```javascript
particleSystem.emitRate = 1000;
```

You can stop the continuous emission of particles by setting a manual emit count.

```javascript
particleSystem.manualEmitCount = 300;
```

In this case the number of particles given by the count are emitted and there is no further emissions of particles.

## Lifetime

The time taken for particles to disappear (or die) after being emitted can be varied within a chosen range. A particle's lifetime is set as a random value between a minimum and maximum

```javascript
particleSystem.minLifeTime = 0.3;
particleSystem.maxLifeTime = 1.5;
```

Short lifetime: <Playground id="#0K3AQ2#37" title="Short Particle Lifetimes" description="Simple example showing how to create particles with a short lifetime."/>
Long lifetime: <Playground id="#0K3AQ2#38" title="Long Particle Lifetimes" description="Simple example showing how to create particles with a long lifetime."/>
