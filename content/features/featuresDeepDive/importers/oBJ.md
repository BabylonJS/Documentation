## OBJ File Import

To use it, you just have to reference the loader file:

```html
<script src="babylon.js"></script>
<script src="babylon.objFileLoader.js"></script>
```

You can find it [here](https://cdn.babylonjs.com/loaders/babylon.objFileLoader.js)

If you are using ES6 imports via NPM, you need to reference with side-effects:

```javascript
import "babylonjs-loaders";
```

You can read more about [NPM support](/setup/frameworkPackages/npmSupport)

### Load

See [how to load from any file type](/features/featuresDeepDive/importers/loadingFileTypes)
Babylon.js will know how to load the obj file and its mtl file automatically:

## Good things to know

- Your model doesn't have to be triangulated, as this loader will do it automatically.
- A Babylon.Mesh will be created for each object/group
- The obj model should be exported with -Z axis forward, and Y axis upward to be compatible with Babylon.js

- By default, due to optimization in the code for loading time, UVs problems can appear, like this :

![Batman UVs problem](/img/how_to/import-obj/uv-issue.jpg)

If you meet this problem, set the variable:

```
BABYLON.OBJFileLoader.OPTIMIZE_WITH_UV = true;
```

Then, you'll have a better texture, but with a longer loading.

Depending on the modeling program you export your OBJ files from, textures may appear distorted or inverted. As a workaround, you can modify your imported model's UV coordinate scale via setting the variable:

```
BABYLON.OBJFileLoader.UV_SCALE = new BABYLON.Vector2(xValue, yValue)
```

Although not part of Wavefront OBJ file format, some OBJ files include vertex colors. If you are loading such a file and want vertices with colors, set the variable:

```
BABYLON.OBJFileLoader.IMPORT_VERTEX_COLORS = true;
```

If you have an OBJ file without normals or wish to have them calculated for you, set the variable:

```
BABYLON.OBJFileLoader.COMPUTE_NORMALS = true;
```

When using OPTIMIZE_WITH_UV = true you may experience some discontinuities in shading. Setting OPTIMIZE_NORMALS will help with this problem:

```
BABYLON.OBJFileLoader.OPTIMIZE_NORMALS = true;
```

To have your imported model inverted on the y-axis, set the variable:

```
BABYLON.OBJFileLoader.INVERT_Y = true;
```

To invert your imported textures on the y-axis, set the variable:

```
BABYLON.OBJFileLoader.INVERT_TEXTURE_Y = true;
```

By default if a MTL file cannot be loaded (missing/error) it will silently fail. The model will still be loaded, but if you want to enforce a stricter loading of materials you can use onSuccess() and onError() callbacks accordingly. Set the variable:

```
BABYLON.OBJFileLoader.MATERIAL_LOADING_FAILS_SILENTLY = false;
```

If a MTL is defined in your OBJ and you wish to have it ignored, set the variable:

```
BABYLON.OBJFileLoader.SKIP_MATERIALS = true;
```

## Supported

- Object/group
- Geometric vertex
  - colors
- Faces
  - triangles
  - quads
  - polygons
- Colors
  - diffuseColor
  - ambientColor
  - specularColor
  - specularPower
  - alpha
- Textures
  - ambientTexture
  - diffuseTexture
  - specularTexture
  - bumpTexture
  - opacityTexture
- Multimaterial
  - For each material defined in the same mesh, it creates a new BABYLON.Mesh.
  - The name of the created BABYLON.Mesh follows this syntax: meshName_mmX
  - X is the nth BABYLON.Mesh created with this method

## Not supported currently

- Smoothing groups (s parameter in OBJ file)
- Illumination (illum parameter in MTL file)
- The differents options for loading textures in MTL file.
- A good description about MTL files and their options can be found here: http://paulbourke.net/dataformats/mtl/
