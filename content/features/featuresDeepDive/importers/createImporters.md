## How to Create Your Own File Importer

By default, babylon.js comes with an importer for .babylon files.

You can also create your own importer by providing a specific object to the `BABYLON.SceneLoader.RegisterPlugin` function.

This object must have three properties:

- A list of supported file extensions (`extensions`)
- An `importMesh` function to import specific meshes
- A `load` function to import complete scene
- A `loadAssets` function to import all babylon elements from the file but do not add them to the scene

Here is a sample importer object:

```javascript
BABYLON.SceneLoader.RegisterPlugin({
  extensions: ".babylon",
  importMesh: function (meshesNames, scene, data, rootUrl, meshes, particleSystems, skeletons) {
    return true;
  },
  load: function (scene, data, rootUrl) {
    return true;
  },
  loadAssets(scene, data, rootUrl) {
    var container = new AssetContainer(scene);
    return container;
  },
});
```

- `meshesNames` is the names of meshes to import
- `scene` is the scene to load data into
- `data` is the string representation of the file to load
- `rootUrl` defines the root URL of your assets
- `meshes` is the list of imported meshes
- `particleSystems` is the list of imported particle systems
- `skeletons` is the list of imported skeletons
