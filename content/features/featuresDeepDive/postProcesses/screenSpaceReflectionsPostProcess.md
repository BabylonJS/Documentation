## Introduction

Rendering reflections in real-time can be done using several methods. Each method contains its own pros and cons. For Web technologies, 2 main methods exist:

- **Using a Mirror Texture**:
  - pros: renders perfect reflections on a plane.
  - cons: limited to one reflection direction and complexity grows according to the scene's geometries.
- **Using a SSR post-process**:
  - pros: renders all possible reflections in all directions and complexity only depends on the screen's resolution (as all post-processes).
  - cons: limited to what the camera sees.

As an example, with SSR enabled (look at the water-tank):
![with_ssr](/img/how_to/screenSpaceReflectionsPostProcess/with_ssr.png)

With SSR disabled:

You can find a simple example of the SSR post-process in our playground:

- <Playground id="#PIZ1GK#303" title="SSR Post Process Example - PBR material" description="Simple example of the screen space reflection Post Process, with PBR material"/>

## Prerequisite

To render reflections using the SSR post-process, the device must support WebGL 2 or at least the multiple render targets extension for WebGL 1. If not supported, the post-process will just work as a pass-through.

To any reflecting geometry in your scene, the post-process must know what are its "reflectivity" properties. To provide these informations, your reflecting meshes must contain for:

- a **Standard Material**: a specular texture. The specular texture will be used to know how much the object reflects for each pixel.
- a **PBR Material**: a reflectivity texture. The post-process doesn't still support the roughness/metallic properties for instance and will be available in future. That means the post-process takes the reflectivity texture as-is and doesn't compute any metallic/roughness workflow.

In other words, don't forget to assign a specular texture or a reflectivity texture to you material if you want the reflections enabled on it.

```javascript
// For a BABYLON.StandardMaterial
myMaterial.specularTexture = new BABYLON.Texture("textures/specular.png", scene);
```

```javascript
// For a BABYLON.PBRMaterial
myMaterial.reflectivityTexture = new BABYLON.Texture("textures/reflectivity.png", scene);
```

**Note: the SSR post-process is a kind of greedy post-process. It is not intended to work smoothly on low-end devices and requires an enough powerful device.**

## Creating the SSR post-process

Just create an instance of BABYLON.ScreenSpaceReflectionPostProcess:

```javascript
var ssr = new BABYLON.ScreenSpaceReflectionPostProcess(
  "ssr", // The name of the post-process
  scene, // The scene where to add the post-process
  1.0, // The ratio of the post-process
  camera, // To camera to attach the post-process
);
```

## Customizing

## Strength

The strength is applied on the overall specular/reflectivity informations in the scene and can be customized. The default value for the strength is 1.0 and should be used only if you are looking for a particular result (means that the result will not be realistic).

```javascript
// Double specular/reflectivity strength.
ssr.strength = 2;
```

Example playground: <Playground id="#PIZ1GK#3" title="SSR Reflective Strength Example" description="Simple example of the reflective strength of the screen space reflection post process."/>

## Falloff Exponent

The falloff exponent is used to linearly reduce the reflection's intensities. The default value is "3.0" and works for most cases.

```javascript
// Reduce more the reflection's intensities
ssr.reflectionSpecularFalloffExponent = 4;
```

Example playground with an almost equal to 0 exponent: <Playground id="#PIZ1GK#2" title="SSR Falloff Example" description="Simple example falloff in the screen space reflection post process."/>

## Quality

The reflections quality can be customized to save performances and should be adjusted to each scene type.

The post-process is based on ray-tracing algorithms. That means more the post-process picks samples, more the result looks good.

The quality is defined as:

- Low: 25 samples.
- Medium: 50 samples.
- High: 100 samples.

According to the nature of the scene, the post-process quality can be not necessary perceptible between the medium and high qualities as the ray-tracing algorithm stops once it finds the reflection color. In other words, the high quality will be not be always needed.

- High quality playground: <Playground id="#PIZ1GK#7" title="High Quality SSR Example" description="Example of high quality screen space reflections."/>
- Medium quality playground: <Playground id="#PIZ1GK#5" title="Medium Quality SSR Example" description="Example of medium quality screen space reflections."/>
- Low quality playground: <Playground id="#PIZ1GK#6" title="Low Quality SSR Example" description="Example of low quality screen space reflections."/>
