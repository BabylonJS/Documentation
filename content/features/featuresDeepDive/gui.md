## Graphical User Interface

There are a number of options for adding a GUI to Babylon.js. The [**Babylon GUI**](/features/featuresDeepDive/gui/gui) is covered in this section.

It allows you to place buttons and labels within in 3D space as well as a 2D front of screen GUI.
When you want a GUI that works in VR or within the 3D space it's the only option.

It is integrated within the playground. For your own projects it has to be loaded as well as Babylon.js.

----------

Other possible GUIs are:

1. CastorGUI, a Babylon.js community extension which overlays the scene
1. Dat.GUI, an external interface
1. HTML GUI
1. HtmlMesh, a Babylon.js addon which allows HTML content to be included in the scene as a scene mesh or an overlay.

## CastorGUI

An alternative 2D GUI is the extension [CastorGUI](/communityExtensions/castorGUI). It has to be loaded both for the playground and for your own projects.

It can be found on [Github](https://github.com/dad72/CastorGUI).

## Dat.GUI

The external [dat.GUI](https://github.com/dataarts/dat.gui) is integrated within the playground. For your own projects it has to be loaded as well as Babylon.js.

## HTML GUI

Since Babylon.js is in JavaScript it is possible to use HTML and CSS to overlay the Babylon.js scene.

### HtmlMesh

The [HtmlMesh](/addons/htmlMesh) extension for BabylonJS allows for HTML content to be incorporated into a scene either as a scene mesh that can occlude and be occluded by other meshes or as an overlay (similar to the HTML GUI example above, but using a mesh so it can be positioned using stadard transforms, parented to other meshes, dragged, and scaled using gizmos, etc...).

## Comparison of GUI Options

Here's a list of the pros and cons of using different types of GUIs. It’s worth noting that these options aren’t mutually exclusive - they can be used together, depending on requirements, for instance:

- Use a simple HTML GUI for initial rapid protoyping, before transitioning to Babylon 2D or 3D GUI
- Use an HTML GUI overlay for complex, dynamic, text-heavy info panels but Babylon 2D GUI for everything else

The sky’s the limit! Go forth and GUI in whatever way takes your fancy!

### HTML-based GUI

#### Pros

- Use familiar HTML, CSS and front-end frameworks like Bootstrap, Tailwind, React, Vue, Svelte & Angular etc
- Near unlimited flexibility & mobile responsiveness
- High performance (as rendered by native browser rather than 3D engine)
- Easier to make WCAG accessibility compliant

#### Cons

- Looser integration with 3D scene
- Can’t have GUI elements directly within 3D scene (e.g. applied to meshes)
- Can’t apply 3D post processing effects to overlaid HTML GUI elements
- Can’t be used for fullscreen/native VR

### UI with HtmlMesh

#### Pros

- Use familiar HTML, CSS and front-end frameworks like Bootstrap, Tailwind, React, Vue, Svelte & Angular etc
- Near unlimited flexibility & mobile responsiveness
- High performance (as rendered by native browser rather than 3D engine)
- Easier to make WCAG accessibility compliant

#### Cons

- Can’t be used in Native or WebXR
- Cannot receive events from iframed content (unless same origin)
- On iOS, pointer interaction with content requires clicking on content first
- Small text can be blurry at some camera angles/distances

### Babylon 2D GUI

#### Pros

- There’s now an awesome [GUI Editor](/toolsAndResources/guiEditor) to make interface creation easier!
- Tight integration with 3D scene
- Ability to optionally apply scene post processing effects to GUI as well
- Ability to apply/link GUI elements and meshes
- Some unique, useful capabilities like nine-patch stretching and sprite-sheet animation that aren’t available with a raw HTML GUI

#### Cons

- Less comprehensive/flexible than HTML GUI (but still more than enough for most requirements)
- Depending on advanced dynamic texture resolution, GUI may look a little blurry
- Possibly some performance considerations
- Can’t be used for fullscreen/native VR

### Babylon 3D GUI

#### Pros

- Supports fullscreen/native VR
- Tight integration with 3D scene
- Ability to optionally apply scene post processing effects to GUI as well

#### Cons

- Less comprehensive/flexible than both Babylon 2D GUI and HTML GUI
