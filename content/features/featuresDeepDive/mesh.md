## Meshes

In the 3D virtual world shapes are built from meshes, lots of triangular facets joined together, each facet made from three vertices.

Babylon.js provides for the creation of predefined meshes, of your own custom meshes and for importing meshes created by 3D design software. For all meshes the underlying data structure is exposed and can be updated.
