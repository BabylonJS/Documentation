The `HTML3DElement` (`<babylon-viewer>`) custom element has a number of attributes and events that are not captured by the API documentation, but are summarized below.

## Attributes

<Alert severity="info">
Note that explicitly specified attribute values are re-applied when a new model is loaded.

| `render-when-idle`        | Indicates that the render loop should run unconditionally. By default, the render loop will be suspended when the visual output does not change frame to frame. This can significantly reduce the energy demand on battery constrained devices.                                                                                                      | Present or absent                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| `environment`             | A url referencing an [environment](/features/featuresDeepDive/materials/using/HDREnvironment). The environment is used for both image based lighting (IBL) and the skybox. This is effectively a shorthand for setting `environment-lighting` and `environment-skybox` to the same texture. Set to `auto` to explicitly use the default environment. | Any valid URL, `auto`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `environment-lighting`    | A url referencing an [environment](/features/featuresDeepDive/materials/using/HDREnvironment). The environment is used for image based lighting (IBL) only. If no environment is provided, and a model with PBR materials is loaded, a default environment will automatically be used. Set to `auto` to explicitly use the default environment.      | Any valid URL, `auto`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

The other values are used to reset the corresponding aspect of the viewer. |
