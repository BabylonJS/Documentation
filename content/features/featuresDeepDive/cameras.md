## Cameras

There are a wide range of cameras to use with Babylon.js, Probably the two most used are the universal and arcRotate cameras and increasingly virtual reality ones.

- _Universal Camera_ - the one to choose for first person shooter type games, and works with all the keyboard, mouse, touch and gamepads. With this camera you can check for collisions and apply gravity.
- _Arc Rotate Camera_ - which acts like a satellite in orbit around a target and always points towards the target position.
- _Follow Camera_ - this takes a mesh as a target and follows it as it moves. Both a free camera version _followCamera_ and an arc rotate version _arcFollowCamera_ are available.
- _Anaglyph Camera_ - extending the use of the Universal and Arc Rotate Cameras for use with red and cyan 3D glasses.
- _Device Orientation Cameras_ - this is a designed to react to a device being tilted forward or back and left or right.
- _Virtual Joysticks Camera_ - on-screen 2D graphics that are used to control the camera or other scene items.

- _Virtual Reality Camera_ a range of cameras for VR devices

Methods are available to change how a camera reacts to inputs and to use multiple cameras.
