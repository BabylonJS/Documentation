## The Babylon.js Flow Graph System

The [Flow Graph](/features/featuresDeepDive/flowGraph/flowGraphBasicConcepts) system is a powerful tool for creating interactive scenes in Babylon.js. It allows developers to create complex interactions and behaviors without writing extensive code, making it accessible to both programmers and non-programmers alike.
The Flow Graph system is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, with a visual interface that allows users to create and manipulate blocks representing different actions and events. This makes it easy to create complex interactions by simply connecting blocks together.
The Flow Graph system is particularly useful for creating interactive experiences in games, simulations, and other applications where user interaction is a key component. It allows developers to create dynamic and responsive environments that can adapt to user input in real-time.

A flow graph is easy to use when it has a corresponding visual editor. For the time being, Babylon's flow graph system does not have a visual editor, but it is planned for future versions of the framework.

Under the hood, the flow graph is being used when glTF with interactivity is loaded. The glTF interactivity graph is converted to a Babylon flow graph, which is then executed when the user interacts with the scene.
