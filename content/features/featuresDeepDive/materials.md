# Materials

Materials give your meshes color and texture. One material in Babylon.js can be used to cover as many meshes as you wish. They can be displayed as a wireframe, scaled and offset across a mesh, have degrees of transparency and be blended. You can apply multiple materials on one mesh and use a dynamic texture as a material that you can draw and write on in real time. Do you need to make your material to appear more textured or bumpier and reflect and refract? The first section shows you how.

Node materials allow you create a material based on custom shaders but without having to deal with shader code.

The advanced section considers more technical aspects of materials and ways of customizing them.
