# Controls

Babylon.js Controls are a set of regular web controls that are super-charged with hardware accelerated rendering through Babylon.js to provide blazing fast dedicated controls.

Babylon.js provides an unified API on top of **WebGL**, **WebGL2** and **WebGPU** that controls can leverage to unleash the raw power of your GPU.
