## ShaderMaterial

The ShaderMaterial object has the necessary methods to pass data from your scene to the Vertex and Fragment Shaders and returns a material that can be applied to any mesh. This returned material effects how the mesh will look based on the code in the shaders.

It is called by

```javascript
var myShaderMaterial = new BABYLON.ShaderMaterial(name, scene, route, options);
```

- `name`: a string, naming the shader
- `scene`: the scene in which the shader is to be used
- `route`: the route to the shader code in one of three ways:

  1. object: `{ vertex: "custom", fragment: "custom" }`, used with `BABYLON.Effect.ShadersStore["customVertexShader"]` and `BABYLON.Effect.ShadersStore["customFragmentShader"]`
  2. object: `{ vertexElement: "vertexShaderCode", fragmentElement: "fragmentShaderCode" }`, used with shader code in `<script>` tags
  3. object: `{ vertexSource: "vertex shader code string", fragmentSource: "fragment shader code string" }` using with strings containing the shaders code
  4. string: `"./COMMON_NAME"`, used with external files _COMMON_NAME.vertex.fx_ and _COMMON_NAME.fragment.fx_ in _index.html_ folder.

- `options`: object containing attributes and uniforms arrays containing their names as strings.

An example:

```javascript
var myShaderMaterial = new BABYLON.ShaderMaterial("shader", scene, "./COMMON_NAME",
    {
        attributes: ["position", "normal", "uv"],
        uniforms: ["world", "worldView", "worldViewProjection", "view", "projection", "time", "direction" ],
        samplers: ["textureSampler"],
        defines: ["MyDefine"]
        needAlphaBlending: true,
        needAlphaTesting: true
});
```

**Note**: that's the exhaustive list of available attributes, uniforms.

Any attribute in the Vertex Shader code **must** appear in the `attributes` array.

The uniform `worldViewProjection` **must** be declared in the Vertex Shader as type `mat4` and **must** be in the `uniforms` array.

Attributes and uniforms named in the arrays and not used in the shader code are ignored.

if your shader code contains #define values, you can specify the ones you want to activate in the `defines` array.

Uniforms assigned to textures in the shader code must be present in the samplers array, all other uniforms must be present in the uniforms array.

Textures are passed, for example, as

```javascript
var amigaTexture = new BABYLON.Texture("amiga.jpg", scene);
myShaderMaterial.setTexture("textureSampler", amigaTexture);
```

where `textureSampler` has been declared as a uniform of type `sampler2D` in the shader code.

Other uniforms are passed, for example, as

```javascript
myShaderMaterial.setFloat("time", 0);
myShaderMaterial.setVector3("direction", BABYLON.Vector3.Zero());
```

the set method depending on the type passed.

## Troubleshoot

In some specific cases when you use post-processes, you might notice a slightly brighter color output than what you implemented in your shader.

Read [this](/features/featuresDeepDive/materials/shaders/image_processing) if you want to know how to fix it.
