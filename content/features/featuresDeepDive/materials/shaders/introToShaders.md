## Introduction to Shaders in Babylon.js

A shader is a program processed by the Graphical Processing Unit (GPU) to produce a screen image by manipulating data to
produce individual pixels. The GPU is optimised, through parallel processing, to deal with these thousand of operations
in an extremely fast way.

## An Overview

### Basic

To produce a Babylon.js scene, code is written in Javascript which the Babylon.js Engine processes and displays the result on screen.
The scene can alter through changes to the meshes, the lights or camera position. To show possible changes in a timely way the screen
display (frame) is re-drawn up to 60 frames per second.

Simplifying, the process is

- Scene Code is processed in the CPU by the BJS Engine Code to produce a Virtual 3D Model
- Virtual 3D Model is processed in the CPU by the BJS Engine Code to produce Shader GPU Code
- Shader GPU Code is processed by GPU to produce screen image.

For example the Babylon.js Engine takes this code

```javascript
const box = BABYLON.MeshBuilder.CreateBox("box", {}, scene);
```

and turns it into vertex data including positions, colors and normals.

The Babylon.js Engine creates the shader code for this data and is passed to the GPU.

### Custom

Much more than this as well as Scene Code you can write your own user Shader Code so that
the process becomes:

- Scene Code is processed in the CPU by the BJS Engine Code to produce a Virtual 3D Model
- Virtual 3D Model and User Shader Code is processed in the CPU by the BJS Engine Code to produce the Shader GPU Code
- Shader GPU Code is processed by GPU to produce the screen image.

## Types of Shader

Shaders are written in Graphics Library Shader Language (GLSL) and come in two parts:

1. Vertex Shader: this takes the data for each vertex and determines where on the screen the pixel for it will be displayed and its color.

2. Fragment Shader: this uses data from the Vertex Shader to determine the position and color of the pixels to represent each facet of the mesh.

Fragment Shaders are sometimes referred to as Pixel Shaders.

## Passing Variables

The vertex data for position, normal and uv coordinates are passed to the Vertex Shader as variables of category attribute.
User data can be passed to both the Vertex Shader and the Fragment Shader as variables of category uniform.
Data can be passed from the Vertex Shader to the Fragment Shader with variables of category varying.

A vital uniform variable to declare in the Vertex Shader is `worldViewProjection` as theBabylon.js Engine uses this to
pass scene 3D - 2D projection data to the Vertex Shader.

![Pass Variables](/img/how_to/Shaders/shade2.jpg)

## Variable types

All variables used in both shaders must be given a type and any numbers assigned to the variable must be consistent with its type.

For example:

```glsl
int n = 2;
float r = 2.0;
```

The following example will throw an error:

```glsl
float r = 2;
```

Some examples of types are

- `vec2`: a two-dimensional vector of floating-point numbers
- `vec3`: a three-dimensional vector of floating-point numbers
- `mat4`: a matrix with 4 columns and 4 rows floating-point numbers
- `sampler2D`: a 2D texture image

Since vertex positions need to be as accurate as possible all floating-point numbers should be set as having high precision.
This is done at the start of the code for each shader using:

```glsl
precision highp float
```

## Built In Variables

The [GLSL](https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/OpenGL_Shading_Language) language has a number of built in variables. Two are vital to the operation of the two shaders and are always necessary:

| Variable     | Description                                                    |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| gl_Position  | provide positional data for screen coordinates                 |
| gl_FragColor | provide color data for the representation of a facet on screen |

## Built In Inputs

| Attribute | Type | Description                                            |
| --------- | ---- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| position  | vec3 | pixel: vertex position / fragment: face pixel position |
| normal    | vec3 | pixel: vertex normal / fragment: face pixel normal     |
| uv        | vec2 | texture coordinate                                     |

&nbsp;

| Uniform             | Type  | Description                                            |
| ------------------- | ----- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| world               | mat4  | mesh global transforming state (move + rotate + scale) |
| worldView           | mat4  | global view part of mesh                               |
| worldViewProjection | mat4  | global camera                                          |
| view                | mat4  | mesh local view part                                   |
| projection          | mat4  | local camera                                           |
| time                | float | per each frame                                         |

## Functions

Functions needed to be typed as do their parameters and have the form:

```glsl
float NAME(typed parameters) {
	*code*
}
```

## Running Shader Code

Both the Vertex and the Fragment Shader are run from a function which must be called `main` and be of type `void` since it returns
no result. It must also type the empty parameter list as `void`:

```glsl
void main(void) {
	*code*
}
```

## Putting Shader Code in Babylon.js

Here are four ways of putting shader code into your scene:

1. Use [BabylonJS Create Your Own Shader (CYOS)](https://www.babylonjs.com/cyos/) and download a zip file
2. Write the Vertex and Fragment Shader Code into `<script>` tags
3. Write, save and import a Vertex and Fragment Shader file of type _.fx_ into your code

More details on this can be found below.
