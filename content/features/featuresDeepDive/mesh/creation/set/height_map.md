## Introduction

In this tutorial, our goal is to understand height maps, a method used to generate realistic terrain.
Height-maps are easy to use, customizable yet produce impressive terrain:

## How to do this?

### How height-maps work

Understanding height maps is the main objective of this tutorial. A height map is simply a gray-scale texture. Each pixel in the texture maps onto the height of a point on a plane, thus the name height-map. The whiter the pixel the higher the displacement, the darker the lesser the displacement. From the variations of gray within the texture we can map out a terrain. For this example we shall use the following texture:

> To help you generate height-map textures (like the one above), you can use software such as [Terragen](https://planetside.co.uk/free-downloads/terragen-4-free-download/), or [Picogen ](https://picogen.org/downloads.php.html)(free).

### Javascript code

Now letâ€™s see this powerful function named `CreateGroundFromHeightMap`:

```javascript
// Create a material with our land texture.
let groundMaterial = new BABYLON.StandardMaterial("ground", scene);
groundMaterial.diffuseTexture = new BABYLON.Texture("Earth__land.jpg", scene);

// Use CreateGroundFromHeightMap to create a height map of 20 units by 20
// And a height of to
// units, with 250 subdivisions in each of the `x` and `z` directions, for a
// total of 62,500 divisions.
const ground = BABYLON.MeshBuilder.CreateGroundFromHeightMap("gdhm", "textures/heightMap.png", {
  width: 20,
  height: 20,
  subdivisions: 250,
  maxHeight: 10,
  minHeight: 2,
});

// Bind our material to our mesh
ground.material = groundMaterial;
```

The parameters passed are:

- **name**: The name of the resulting mesh
- **Height-map texture**: The URL of the height-map texture.
- **options**: The options for producing the height-map.
- **scene**: The scene to append the resulting mesh
- **updatable**: Boolean to specify if the mesh should be updatable.
- **successCallback**: Callback that resolves to the successfully produced height-map terrain.

The following are options, third parameter, used to construct the height-mapped plane:

- **width**: The width of the plane
- **height**: The height of the plane
- **minHeight**: Lowest point on the plane
- **maxHeight**: Highest point on the plane
- **subdivisions**: How detailed should our height-mapped plane be. Higher for higher poly count and therefore better visual quality. As seen below:

### Tips.

If a height-map negatively impacts performance try reducing the subdivisions to reduce the number of polygons on the mesh. For further documentation go [here](https://doc.babylonjs.com/typedoc/classes/babylon.groundbuilder#creategroundfromheightmap).
