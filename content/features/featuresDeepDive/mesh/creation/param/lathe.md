## Lathe

A lathed shape is created by defining a shape profile using vector3 coordinates in the xy plane. The shape profile will be rotated around the y axis to form the lather shape. It is recommended that all the x values are positive. You must set at least the _shape_ option.

On creation the local origin of a lathed shape is coincident with the world origin. It is not possible to give a position relative to the constructed shape as this depends on the data sets used.

There in no _instance_ option for lathed shapes

## MeshBuilder

Usage :

```javascript
const lathe = BABYLON.MeshBuilder.CreateLathe("lathe", options, scene); //scene is optional and defaults to the current scene
```

| option          | value                                                                                               | default value     |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| shape           | _(Vector3[])_ array of Vector3, the shape you want to turn **REQUIRED**                             |
| radius          | _(number)_ the value to radius of the lathe                                                         | 1                 |
| tessellation    | _(number)_ the number of iteration around the lathe                                                 | 64                |
| arc             | _(number)_ ratio of the circumference between 0 and 1                                               | 1                 |
| cap             | _(number)_ tube cap : NO_CAP, CAP_START, CAP_END, CAP_ALL                                           | NO_CAP            |
| closed          | _(boolean)_ to open/close the lathe circumference, should be set to `false` when used with `arc`    | true              |
| updatable       | _(boolean)_ true if the mesh is updatable                                                           | false             |
| sideOrientation | _(number)_ side orientation                                                                         | DEFAULTSIDE       |
| frontUVs        | _(Vector4)_ **ONLY WHEN sideOrientation:BABYLON.Mesh.DOUBLESIDE is an option**                      | Vector4(0,0, 1,1) |
| backUVs         | _(Vector4)_ **ONLY WHEN sideOrientation:BABYLON.Mesh.DOUBLESIDE is an option**                      | Vector4(0,0, 1,1) |
| invertUV        | _(boolean)_ to swap the U and V coordinates at geometry construction time (texture rotation of 90Â°) | false             |

The radius value is a multiplier for the x values in the profile shape vector3s.

## Mesh

Usage:

```javascript
let lathe = BABYLON.Mesh.CreateLathe("lathe", shape, radius, tessellation, scene);
let lathe = BABYLON.Mesh.CreateLathe("lathe", shape, radius, tessellation, scene, updatable, sideOrientation); //optional parameters after scene
```

Note the limited parameters for this method
