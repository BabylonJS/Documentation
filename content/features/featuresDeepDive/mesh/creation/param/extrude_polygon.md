## Extruded Non Regular Polygon

_ExtrudePolygon_ adds a _depth_ option to _CreatePolygon_. The extrusion is carried out down the vertical y axis from the polygon shape in the horizontal xz plane. Like _CreatePolygon_ it requires an Earcut script. Since it can be concave it requires a procedure to fill the polygon with triangles and an Earcut method is used. Whilst an Earcut script is pre-loaded in the Playground you will have to add a reference to such a script in your own projects. One is available at [cdn](https://unpkg.com/earcut@2.1.1/dist/earcut.min.js) or via a [npm package](https://github.com/mapbox/earcut#install).

On creation the local origin of the extruded polygon is coincident with the world origin. It is not possible to give a position relative to the extruded polygon as this depends on the data sets used.

_ExtrudePolygon_ calls [PolygonMeshBuilder](/features/featuresDeepDive/mesh/creation/param/polyMeshBuilder). There is no _instance_ option. You must set at least the _shape_ and _depth_ options.

## MeshBuilder

Usage :

```javascript
const extrudedPolygon = BABYLON.MeshBuilder.ExtrudePolygon("polygon", options, scene); //scene is optional and defaults to the current scene
```

| option          | value                                                                                                                                | default value                    |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| shape           | _(Vector3[])_ array of Vector3, the shape you want to turn **REQUIRED**                                                              |
| depth           | _(number)_ the depth of the extrusion **REQUIRED**                                                                                   |
| faceColors      | _(Color4[])_ array of 3 _Color4_, one per box face                                                                                   | Color4(1, 1, 1, 1) for each side |
| faceUV          | _(Vector4[])_ array of 3 _Vector4_, one per box face                                                                                 | UVs(0, 0, 1, 1) for each side    |
| wrap            | _(boolean)_ maps texture to sides with faceUV[1] when false texture mapped to each individual side, when true wrapped over all sides | false                            |
| holes           | _(Vector3[][])_ array of holes, each hole being an array of successive Vector3                                                       | []                               |
| updatable       | _(boolean)_ true if the mesh is updatable                                                                                            | false                            |
| sideOrientation | _(number)_ side orientation                                                                                                          | DEFAULTSIDE                      |

All vectors for shape and holes are Vector3 and should be in the xz plane, ie of the form BABYLON.Vector3(x, 0, z) and in **counter clockwise** order;

## Mesh

```javascript
let polygon = BABYLON.Mesh.CreatePolygon("polygon", shape, depth, scene);
let polygon = BABYLON.Mesh.CreatePolygon("polygon", shape, depth, scene, holes, updatable, sideOrientation); //optional parameters after scene
```
