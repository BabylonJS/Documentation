## Custom Polyhedra

These are a further range of polyhedra that you can create although they need more steps to achieve. This is the reason for the _custom_ option. All the other options, other than _type_, can be used with custom polyhedra.

1.  Visit <Playground id="#WL3U6F" title="Custom Polyhedra" description="Simple example of custom polyhedra in Babylon.js."/> and minimize the code editor by unchecking the box by Editor under the Gear icon &#9881; (Options) and note the polyhedron names under the mouse pointer.  
    ![Select a Polyhedron](/img/how_to/Mesh/polyhedra1.jpg);

2.  From the polyhedra.js file at https://github.com/BabylonJS/Extensions/tree/master/Polyhedron find the required name

```javascript
HeptagonalPrism : {
"name":"Heptagonal Prism",
"category":["Prism"],
"vertex":[[0,0,1.090071],[0.796065,0,0.7446715],[-0.1498633,0.7818315,0.7446715],[-0.7396399,-0.2943675,0.7446715],[0.6462017,0.7818315,0.3992718],[1.049102,-0.2943675,-0.03143449],[-0.8895032,0.487464,0.3992718],[-0.8658909,-0.6614378,-0.03143449],[0.8992386,0.487464,-0.3768342],[0.5685687,-0.6614378,-0.6538232],[-1.015754,0.1203937,-0.3768342],[-0.2836832,-0.8247995,-0.6538232],[0.4187054,0.1203937,-0.9992228],[-0.4335465,-0.042968,-0.9992228]],
"face":[[0,1,4,2],[0,2,6,3],[1,5,8,4],[3,6,10,7],[5,9,12,8],[7,10,13,11],[9,11,13,12],[0,3,7,11,9,5,1],[2,4,8,12,13,10,6]]},
```

3. Copy/paste the wanted polyhedron object in your code like this :

```javascript
const heptagonalPrism = {
  name: "Heptagonal Prism",
  category: ["Prism"],
  vertex: [
    [0, 0, 1.090071],
    [0.796065, 0, 0.7446715],
    [-0.1498633, 0.7818315, 0.7446715],
    [-0.7396399, -0.2943675, 0.7446715],
    [0.6462017, 0.7818315, 0.3992718],
    [1.049102, -0.2943675, -0.03143449],
    [-0.8895032, 0.487464, 0.3992718],
    [-0.8658909, -0.6614378, -0.03143449],
    [0.8992386, 0.487464, -0.3768342],
    [0.5685687, -0.6614378, -0.6538232],
    [-1.015754, 0.1203937, -0.3768342],
    [-0.2836832, -0.8247995, -0.6538232],
    [0.4187054, 0.1203937, -0.9992228],
    [-0.4335465, -0.042968, -0.9992228],
  ],
  face: [
    [0, 1, 4, 2],
    [0, 2, 6, 3],
    [1, 5, 8, 4],
    [3, 6, 10, 7],
    [5, 9, 12, 8],
    [7, 10, 13, 11],
    [9, 11, 13, 12],
    [0, 3, 7, 11, 9, 5, 1],
    [2, 4, 8, 12, 13, 10, 6],
  ],
};

const heptPrism = BABYLON.MeshBuilder.CreatePolyhedron("h", { custom: heptagonalPrism }, scene); //scene is optional and defaults to the current scene

//also possible
const heptPrism1 = BABYLON.Mesh.CreatePolyhedron("h", { custom: heptagonalPrism }, scene); //scene is optional and defaults to the current scene
```
