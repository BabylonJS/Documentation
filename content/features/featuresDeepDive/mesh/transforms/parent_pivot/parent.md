## Overview of a Parent

Using a parent is an alternative method to using a Babylon.js [pivot](/features/featuresDeepDive/mesh/transforms/parent_pivot/pivots) to set the center of transformation for a mesh, that is the point used as the center of rotation or the center of enlargement. To rotate or scale a mesh using a parent as a center of transformation you apply the rotation or scaling vectors to the parent. This is different to using a Babylon.js pivot to rotate or scale a mesh.

Making mesh P a parent of mesh C, changes the frame of reference for mesh C to the local axes of mesh P. Repositioning, rotating or scaling mesh P will apply the same transformations to mesh C. Positioning, rotating and scaling of mesh C will depend on the position and orientation of the local axes of C relative to those of P.

Please note that non-uniform scaling (scaling with different values on different axes) is not supported on parent nodes. Indeed, decomposition of such a Matrix would result in supporting [shear mapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shear_mapping) at the transform level. That has not been added out of concern for performance.

To parent mesh C to mesh P you use any of these three methods

```javascript
meshC.parent = meshP; // 1
meshC.setParent(meshP); // 2
meshP.addChild(meshC); // 3
```

... however the resulting behavior won't always match perfectly. Specifically, the order in which you set position and apply rotation to the parent mesh will affect the result if method 2 or 3 (but not if method 1) was used.

The following playgrounds show the different behaviors

<Playground id="#NRNBMM" title="Transform C and P After Parenting" description="Simple example of transforming C and P after parenting."/>
<Playground id="#NRNBMM#1" title="Transform C Before and P After Parenting" description="Simple example of transforming C before and P after parenting."/>
<Playground id="#NRNBMM#2" title="Transform P Before and C After Parenting" description="Simple example of transforming P before and C after parenting."/>
<Playground id="#NRNBMM#3" title="Transform C and P Before Parenting" description="Simple example of transforming C and P before parenting."/>

To remove a child (mesh C) from a parent (mesh P) use any of these methods

```javascript
meshC.parent = null; // 1
meshC.setParent(null); // 2
meshP.removeChild(meshC); // 3
```

The following playground demonstrates how using method #1 does not _just_ remove the parent from the child (mesh C, red in color), but _also_ removes from the child any transformations applied via the parent and leaves only the transformations applied directly to the child mesh. The moment when the parent is removed from mesh C using method #1, position, rotation and scale of mesh C will visibly change in the scene view. Methods #2 and #3 do remove the parent-child relationship, but any transformations to mesh C applied via mesh P up to the point of removal will remain. Position, rotation and scale of mesh C will never visibly change when its parent is removed using method #2 or #3.

## How To Use a Parent

The parent method for these examples can be directly compared to [transforming coordinates](/features/featuresDeepDive/mesh/transforms/center_origin/transform_coords)

## Satellite

Take a box that is rotating and translating from the top of which emerges a smaller box and travels in a direction always perpendicular to the top face of the box.

By parenting the smaller box to the box rotations, positions and scaling given to the parent are also applied to the child. Rotations, positions and scaling given to the child take place inside the frame of reference of the parent.

The following code gives the animation.

```javascript
scene.registerAfterRender(function () {
    box.rotate(BABYLON.Axis.Y, Math.PI / 150, BABYLON.Space.LOCAL);
    box.rotate(BABYLON.Axis.X, Math.PI / 200, BABYLON.Space.LOCAL);
    box.translate(new BABYLON.Vector3(-1, -1, -1).normalize(), 0.001, BABYLON.Space.WORLD);
    y += 0.001;
    small.translate(BABYLON.Axis.Y, 0.001, BABYLON.Space.LOCAL);
});
```

## Disc World

Imagine a disc flying around space with building on it. In fact the following example uses a thin cylinder as the disc since the top circular face is horizontal whilst the face of a disc in Babylon.js is vertical. (OK it doesn't make any real difference but it more natural to start with a horizontal ground).

The building will be an array of boxes with each box parented to the disc.

```javascript
var phi = 0;
scene.registerAfterRender(function () {
    matrix = disc.getWorldMatrix();
    disc.rotate(BABYLON.Axis.Y, Math.PI / 150, BABYLON.Space.LOCAL);
    disc.rotate(BABYLON.Axis.Z, Math.PI / 200, BABYLON.Space.LOCAL);
    disc.position = new BABYLON.Vector3(15 * Math.cos(phi), 16 * Math.sin(phi), 5);
    phi += 0.01;
});
```

## Negative scaling and local transformation

When parenting a node with negative values for the scaling, some axis might change sign. When computing child local transform, all axis are assumed to be positive. This is the default behavior for legacy reason. It's however possible to keep the scaling axis sign. When calling `addChild` and `removeChild`, a second optional boolean parameter will keep sign when set to true. Both function recompute scaling value. So, set parameter to true when add or removing child.
