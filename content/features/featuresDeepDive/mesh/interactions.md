## Interactions

Possibly the most important interactions you can have are user interactions when picking a mesh in the scene for example. These can be achieved with scene observables.

You often also need to find whether to meshes are intersecting or the relative position of a mesh with reference to another mesh, camera or point in space. These can be achieved in Babylon.js using _intersectsMesh_, for two meshes and for ray casting _Ray_ and _intersect_.
