## Bones and Skeletons

Babylon.js supports bones animations for your meshes.

![Bones](/img/how_to/bones-skeletons/bones.jpg)

Basically a skeleton (`BABYLON.Skeleton`) contains a hierarchy of bones (`BABYLON.Bone`). A bone is defined by a name, a parent (can be null) and a transformation matrix.

Here are the constructors:

- `BABYLON.Skeleton` = function (name, id, scene)
- `BABYLON.Bone` = function (name, skeleton, parentBone, matrix)

Inside a skeleton, bones can be found inside the `skeleton.bones` array.

A bone can contain animations to animate its `matrix` property.

A bone must have its inverted absolute transform matrix set. If you are importing a skeleton this might already be computed. But if you are creating your own skeleton programmatically you need to do this in your code.

The easiest way to do it is:

```javascript
skeleton.returnToRest();
```

## Preparing mesh

A skeleton can be applied to a mesh through the `mesh.skeleton` property.

You should note that babylon.js supports up to **4 bones influences per vertex**.

The mesh must also have additional vertices data:

- _Matrices weights_: 4 floats to weight bones matrices  
  (`mesh.setVerticesData(BABYLON.VertexBuffer.MatricesWeightsKind, matricesWeights, false)`)
- _Matrices indices_: 4 floats to index bones matrices  
  (`mesh.setVerticesData(BABYLON.VertexBuffer.MatricesIndicesKind, floatIndices, false)`)

The final matrix applied to each vertex is computed as follows:

```javascript
finalMatrix = worldMatrix * (bonesMatrices[index0] * weight0 + bonesMatrices[index1] * weight1 + bonesMatrices[index2] * weight2 + bonesMatrices[index3] * weight3);
```

On low-end hardware, the maximum bones influences per vertex is reduced to 3.

By default the system will try to store the bone matrices into a texture to save shader uniforms. If you still want to use shader uniforms, you can call:

```javascript
skeleton.useTextureToStoreBoneMatrices = false;
```

## Loading bones

Skeletons and bones can be loaded from .babylon files.

Here is a sample of how to load a boned mesh and how to launch skeleton animation:

```javascript
BABYLON.ImportMeshAsync("scenes/Dude/Dude.babylon", scene).then(function (result) {
  scene.createDefaultCameraOrLight(true, true, true);
  scene.createDefaultEnvironment();

  scene.beginAnimation(result.skeletons[0], 0, 100, true, 1.0);
});
```

A complete running example can be found here: <Playground id="#92Y727#462" title="Loading Bones" description="Simple example of loading bones." isMain={true} category="Mesh"/>

## Use Bones with Node Material

The [Node Material](/features/featuresDeepDive/materials/node_material) is a powerful tool that allows creating shaders without having to write [GLSL](https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/OpenGL_Shading_Language). To use a Node Material in a mesh with bones, you need to add the Bones node to it so that the bone influences are correctly computed:

![Use Instances with Node Material](/img/how_to/bones-node.png)

<Playground id="#92Y727#463" title="Using Node Material with Bones" description="Use Bones node on the Node Material"/>

## Cloning bones

Bones and skeletons can be cloned (This is the case with the rabbits in the previous link).

Here is a sample of how to load and clone a mesh and its skeleton:

```javascript
BABYLON.ImportMeshAsync("Scenes/Rabbit/Rabbit.babylon", scene, { meshNames: "Rabbit" }).then(function (result) {
  const rabbit = result.meshes[1];

  rabbit.scaling = new BABYLON.Vector3(0.4, 0.4, 0.4);
  shadowGenerator.getShadowMap().renderList.push(rabbit);

  const rabbit2 = rabbit.clone("rabbit2");
  const rabbit3 = rabbit.clone("rabbit2");

  rabbit2.position = new BABYLON.Vector3(-50, 0, -20);
  rabbit2.skeleton = rabbit.skeleton.clone("clonedSkeleton");

  rabbit3.position = new BABYLON.Vector3(50, 0, -20);
  rabbit3.skeleton = rabbit.skeleton.clone("clonedSkeleton2");

  scene.beginAnimation(result.skeletons[0], 0, 100, true, 0.8);
  scene.beginAnimation(rabbit2.skeleton, 73, 100, true, 0.8);
  scene.beginAnimation(rabbit3.skeleton, 0, 72, true, 0.8);
});
```

## Cloning Complex Models

More complex models, such as the Dude, contain submeshes. When cloning you must iterate and clone the submeshes as well. Here is an example of how to clone a more complex model:

```javascript
BABYLON.ImportMeshAsync("Dude/dude.babylon", scene, { meshNames: "him" }).then(function (result) {
  result.meshes[0].position = new BABYLON.Vector3(0, 0, 5); // The original dude
  scene.beginAnimation(result.skeletons[0], 0, 120, 1.0, true);

  dudes = [];

  for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    // 10 clones
    const xrand = Math.floor(Math.random() * 501) - 250;
    const zrand = Math.floor(Math.random() * 501) - 250;

    const c = [];

    for (j = 1; j < result.meshes.length; j++) {
      c[j] = result.meshes[j].clone("c" + j);
      c[j].position = new BABYLON.Vector3(xrand, 0, zrand);
      c[j].skeleton = result.meshes[j].skeleton.clone();
      scene.beginAnimation(c[j].skeleton, 0, 120, 1.0, true);
    }
    dudes[i] = c;
  }
});
```

## Picking a mesh attached to a skeleton

Because bone transformations are applied to the vertices on the GPU, the CPU has no clue where the mesh's vertices are. So picking a mesh with a skeleton will only work on the bind pose which could be sub-optimal.

You can decide to call `mesh.refreshBoundingInfo(true)` to force the CPU to update its local version of the mesh so that you can pick it correctly:

```javascript
mesh.refreshBoundingInfo(true);
const pickResult = scene.pick(scene.pointerX, scene.pointerY);
```

Please keep in mind that this operation is using the CPU so it has to be used wisely as it could impact performance.

That being said, starting with Babylon 7.12, you can now use a new class to use the GPU to compute complex meshes' bounding info:

```javascript
var bbHelper = new BABYLON.BoundingInfoHelper(engine);
await bbHelper.computeAsync(scene.meshes);
```

That class will use Transform Feedbacks on WebGL2 and Compute Shaders on WebGPU to compute the bounding info.
<Playground id="#BCNJD4#42" engine="webgpu" title="Computing Bounding Info with the GPU" description="Simple example of how to use BoundingInfoHelper."/>

Please note that there is a limit to be aware of: The GPU will be faster only if the objects to scan are complex enough. Else the price to upload data to the GPU and prepare shaders will not be compensated.

## Attaching a mesh to a specific bone

Starting with babylon.js v2.2, you can now attach a mesh to a bone (like a sword in the hand of your character for instance). To do so, just specify on which bone with the following code:

```javascript
sword.attachToBone(skeleton.bones[34], character);
```

Please note that you also need to specify on which mesh the bone is currently applied.
You can find a sample here: <Playground id="#11BH6Z#18" title="Attaching a Mesh To a Bone" description="Simple example of attaching a mesh to a specific bone."/>

When you attach a mesh to a bone in a skeleton, the mesh will be scaled by the same scaling factor as the parent mesh of the skeleton. This may not always be what you want. You may want to preserve the size of the mesh before and after attaching to a bone. To achieve this, scale the mesh appropriately before attaching it to the bone so that the net effect is to keep the size of the mesh intact before and after attachment. For example, if the parent mesh of the skeleton has a scaling factor (2, 2, 3) you have to scale the attached mesh by a factor (1/2, 1/2, 1/3) or (0.5, 0.5, 0.333 ).

The current position of the mesh in the world coordinates determines how far away the mesh will appear from the bone. If the mesh is far from the origin of the world, then it will appear far from the bone as well which, again, may not be what you want. So before attaching a mesh to a bone set its position to (0, 0, 0) or to a position close to world origin so that the mesh appears close to the bone and appears attached. The position of the mesh in this case simply acts as its offset from the bone.

## Rotating, Positioning, and Scaling bones

Starting with babylon.js v2.5, you can easily position, rotate, and scale bones.

Bones can be rotated and positioned in local space and world space. To move a bone in world space, you must pass BABYLON.Space.WORLD and the mesh to the method. If a space isn't passed to the method, then the bone is moved in local space (relative to the parent bone).

### Rotating

To rotate a bone around an axis, use the rotate function:

```javascript
bone.rotate(axis, angle, BABYLON.Space.WORLD, mesh);
```

- <Playground id="#D4ZZ8#2" title="Rotated World Space" description="Simple example of rotating bones in world space."/>
- <Playground id="#D4ZZ8#4" title="Rotated Local Space" description="Simple example of rotating bones in local space."/>

setAxisAngle, setYawPitchRoll, setRotation, or setRotationMatrix are used to rotate a bone to a specific rotation.

```javascript
bone.setAxisAngle(axis, angle, BABYLON.Space.WORLD, mesh);
```

- setAxisAngle world space: <Playground id="#D4ZZ8#8" title="SetAxisAngle World Space Demo 1" description="Simple example of using the setAxisAngle property in world space."/>
- setAxisAngle world space: <Playground id="#D4ZZ8#9" title="SetAxisAngle World Space Demo 2" description="Simple example of using the setAxisAngle property in world space."/>
- setAxisAngle local space: <Playground id="#D4ZZ8#10" title="SetAxisAngle Local Space Demo 1" description="Simple example of using the setAxisAngle property in local space."/>
- setAxisAngle local space: <Playground id="#D4ZZ8#11" title="SetAxisAngle Local Space Demo 2" description="Simple example of using the setAxisAngle property in local space."/>

```javascript
bone.setYawPitchRoll(yaw, pitch, roll, BABYLON.Space.WORLD, mesh);
```

<Playground id="#I6RJJ#56" title="Set Yaw Pitch Roll Example" description="Simple example of using the setYawPitchRoll method."/>

```javascript
bone.setRotation(rotation, BABYLON.Space.WORLD, mesh);
```

<Playground id="#I6RJJ#60" title="setRotation Example" description="Simple example of using the setRotation method."/>

```javascript
bone.setRotationQuaternion(quat, BABYLON.Space.WORLD, mesh);
```

<Playground id="#I6RJJ#61" title="setRotationQuaternion Example" description="Simple example of using the setRotationQuaternion method."/>

```javascript
bone.setRotationMatrix(rotMat, BABYLON.Space.WORLD, mesh);
```

<Playground id="#I6RJJ#57" title="setRotationMatrix Example" description="Simple example of using the setRotationMatrix method."/>

Use getRotation or getRotationToRef to get the Vector3 rotation of a bone.

```javascript
const rotation = bone.getRotation(BABYLON.Space.WORLD, mesh);
```

```javascript
const rotation = BABYLON.Vector3.Zero();

bone.getRotationToRef(BABYLON.Space.WORLD, mesh, rotation);
```

<Playground id="#1EVNNB#12" title="getRotationToRef Example" description="Simple example of using the getRotationToRef method."/>

Use getRotationQuaternion or getRotationQuaternionToRef to get the Quaternion rotation of a bone.

```javascript
const rotationQuaternion = bone.getRotationQuaternion(BABYLON.Space.WORLD, mesh);
```

```javascript
const rotationQuaternion = BABYLON.Vector3.Zero();

bone.getRotationQuaternionToRef(BABYLON.Space.WORLD, mesh, rotationQuaternion);
```

<Playground id="#1EVNNB#11" title="getRotationQuaternionToRef Example" description="Simple example of using the getRotationQuaternionToRef method."/>

You can also use `bone.rotation` to set and get local space rotation quaternion.

### Positioning

To change the position of a bone, you can rotate the parent bone, or you can leave the parent where it is and directly modify the position of the bone.

One way to do this is by translating the bone from its current position.

```javascript
bone.translate(x, y, z, BABYLON.Space.WORLD, mesh);
```

<Playground id="#1BZJVJ#32" title="translate Example" description="Simple example of using the translate method."/>

If you need to set the bone to a specific location, use setPosition.

```javascript
bone.setPosition(pos, BABYLON.Space.WORLD, mesh);
```

- <Playground id="#1BZJVJ#33" title="setPosition Example 1" description="Simple example of using the setPosition method."/>
- <Playground id="#1BZJVJ#34" title="setPosition Example 2" description="Simple example of using the setPosition method."/>

To get the position of a bone, use getPosition or getPositionToRef.

```javascript
const pos = bone.getPosition(BABYLON.Space.WORLD, mesh);
```

```javascript
const pos = BABYLON.Vector3.Zero();

bone.getPositionToRef(BABYLON.Space.WORLD, mesh, pos);
```

<Playground id="#1EVNNB#14" title="getPositionToRef Example" description="Simple example of using the getPositionToRef method."/>

You can also use `bone.position` to set and get local space position.

### Scaling

You can scale a bone on the local x, y, z axes of the bone (it is a cumulative effect).

```javascript
bone.scale(scaleX, scaleY, scaleZ);
```

<Playground id="#1EVNNB#9" title="scale Example" description="Simple example of using the scale method."/>

The last parameter of scale is scaleChildren. Set scaleChildren to true if you want the scale to affect all the children / descendants of the bone. By default this parameter is off.

<Playground id="#1BZJVJ#117" title="scale Children Example" description="Simple example of using the scale method."/>

scale is called on every frame, because the character's animation resets the scale of the bones.

The setScale function can be used to directly set a bone to a certain scale vector value.

```javascript
bone.setScale(scaleVector);
```

<Playground id="#D9U0UW#1" title="setScale Example" description="Simple example of using the setScale method."/>

Use getScale or getScaleToRef to get the current scale of a bone.

```javascript
const scale = bone.getScale();
```

```javascript
const scale = BABYLON.Vector.Zero();
bone.getScaleToRef(scale);
```

You can also use `bone.scaling` to set and get local space scaling.

## Bone Controllers

Babylon.js v2.5 also introduced Bone controllers.

### BoneLookController

The BoneLookController class is used to make a bone look toward a point in space.

With some bones, you will need to adjust the yaw, pitch, roll to get the bone to look in the right direction.

```javascript
const target = BABYLON.MeshBuilder.createSphere();
const lookCtrl = new BABYLON.BoneLookController(characterMesh, headBone, target.position, { adjustYaw: Math.PI * 0.5, adjustPitch: Math.PI * 0.5, adjustRoll: Math.PI });

scene.registerBeforeRender(function () {
  lookCtrl.update();
});
```

<Playground id="#1B1PUZ#15" title="registerBeforeRender Example" description="Simple example of using the registerBeforeRender method."/>

### BoneIKController

Inverse Kinematics (IK) is used to rotate a chain of bones so that the end of the first bone is at or closest to a target point. It's often used to rotate the limbs of a character.

The BoneIKController class is modeled after Blender's IK Bone Constraint, but is currently limited to 2 bones.

To use the BoneIKController, you must first create a target mesh and a pole target mesh.

```javascript
const target = BABYLON.MeshBuilder.CreateSphere("", { diameter: 5 }, scene);
const poleTarget = BABYLON.MeshBuilder.CreateSphere("", { diameter: 2.5 }, scene);
```

The bones will reach for the target mesh and the position of the pole target will determine how the joint between the bones will bend.

You most likely will want to parent your character to the pole target mesh so that it will move relative to the character.

```javascript
poleTarget.parent = characterMesh;
```

The BoneIKController constructor takes the mesh of the character, the bone that will be closest to the target, the target, and an options param. The current list of options are:

- targetMesh
- poleTargetMesh
- poleTargetBone
- poleTargetLocalOffset
- poleAngle
- bendAxis
- maxAngle

```javascript
const ikCtrl = new BABYLON.BoneIKController(characterMesh, forearmBone, { targetMesh: target, poleTargetMesh: poleTarget, poleAngle: Math.PI });
```

To use the controller, simply call the controller's update function before the scene is rendered.

```javascript
scene.registerBeforeRender(function () {
  ikCtrl.update();
});
```

<Playground id="#1EVNNB#15" title="registerBeforeRender Example" description="Simple example of using the registerBeforeRender method."/>

If you used a mesh for a target, you can hide it by setting enabled to false.

```javascript
target.setEnabled(false);
poleTarget.setEnabled(false);
```

## Performance considerations

Bones are computed using shaders by default. This allows better performance. But on low end devices, shaders could be limited and not able to process bones. You can in this case ask Babylon.js to compute bones using CPU by setting `mesh.computeBonesUsingShaders = false`.

Note however that when using instances / thin instances, things can be a bit different:

1. When `computeBonesUsingShaders = true`, the vertex shader code is doing 16 texture reads **PER** vertex **PER** instance **PER** frame (it's 32 if you have more than 4 influences per vertex - 8 being the maximum supported by Babylon.js)
1. When `computeBonesUsingShaders = false`, there's no texture reads anymore but the vertices are transformed according to their bones on the CPU and the final vertex positions are uploaded to the GPU once **PER** frame.

As 2 is independent from the number of instances and has a fixed cost (depending on the number of vertices), there’s a point where 2 will be faster than 1, and it will be more and more in favor of 2 with increasing number of instances.

If you are in a situation where 1 is slower than 2, you can try another option:

- `mesh.computeBonesUsingShaders = true`
- `mesh.skeleton.useTextureToStoreBoneMatrices = false`

In this configuration, bones will be applied on the GPU but using a static bone array, there's no texture read involved. So it will probably be faster than 1 but note that this latest configuration will set a limit to the total number of bones a skeleton can have (which depends on the number of uniforms a vertex shader can take).

**Warning**: `mesh.computeBonesUsingShaders = false` is incompatible with morph targets! If you have to use morph targets, you must set `mesh.computeBonesUsingShaders` to `true`!

## Debugging

Starting with Babylon.js v4.0, you can use the Inspector to turn [skeleton viewer](/toolsAndResources/inspector#bones-viewer) on and off.

### Debugging Extras

Starting with Babylon.js v4.2, you have a few more options to debug a skeleton with. We now have incorporated additional bone views, to help visualize the position of the bones which are accessible through the same means as explained in the above sections' Inspector link. Additionally two new methods have been added to construct ShaderMaterials for both a skeleton map and assigned bone weights.

#### New Viewer Info

There are some requirements to take into consideration when trying to use the view modes for the skeleton viewer. First the SkeletonViewer class accepts a new constructor argument of options that will dictate the visual look of the debug mesh. Through this new argument there a bunch of new options to configure the outcome. Note that this is not a required parameter and if omitted then the debug mesh will use classic lines system.

There are some differences in with the new views from how the old lines view functioned. With the old method, for each bone per frame the points are updated and the line system is redrawn with its buffer being updated (all of which happens on the CPU). The new views are a unified mesh that match the matrices of the skeleton system. There is some impact at creation time to properly create the buffers, but once that is done it offers more performance and less impact as it is handled after inception by the GPU. Keep in mind to make sure your skeleton has proper restPose Matrices bound and updated, otherwise the debug mesh will fail to position itself correctly.

```javascript
let skeletonView = new BABYLON.Debug.SkeletonViewer(
  skeleton, //Target Skeleton
  mesh, //That skeletons Attached Mesh or a Node with the same globalMatrix
  scene, //The Scene scope
  false, //autoUpdateBoneMatrices?
  mesh.renderingGroupId > 0 ? mesh.renderingGroupId + 1 : 1, // renderingGroupId
  options, //Configuration Options
);
```

To configure some of how the parsing happens you can change these values. Also take note that the options for the display modes lives here as well.

```javascript
let options {
   pauseAnimations?: boolean, //True or False flag to pause the animations while trying to construct the debugMesh. Default: True
   returnToRest?: boolean, //Flag to force the skeleton back into its restPose before constructing the debugMesh. Default: False
   computeBonesUsingShaders?: boolean, //Tell the debugMesh to use or not use the GPU for its calculations, if you ever want to do picking on the mesh this will need to be False. Default: True
   useAllBones?: boolean, //Visualize all bones or skip the ones with no influence.
   displayMode?: number //A value that controls which display mode to use. (SkeletonViewer.DISPLAY_LINES = 0, SkeletonViewer.DISPLAY_SPHERES = 1, SkeletonViewer.DISPLAY_SPHERE_AND_SPURS = 2). Default = 0.
   displayOptions?: any //The visual parameters for the debugMeshes.
};
```

In order to configure the new views display options, we have these new parameters.

```javascript
let displayModeOptions {
   sphereBaseSize? : number, //The size of the sphere when scaled by the sphereScaleUnit after determining the longest bone in the system. Default = 0.15
   sphereScaleUnit? : number, //The number that is used to determine the ratio of the spheres scale in relation to the longest bone in the system.  Defaults to 2, with general assumptions that 1 scene unit is treated as 1 meter (you can assume what ever scene unit though).
   sphereFactor? : number, //A scalar that makes the spheres get smaller the farther away from the root bone they are. Default = 0.865
   midStep? : number, //The number that represents where the bones 'spur' will be at its maximum thickness. Default = 0.235
   midStepFactor? : number, //The ratio of how thick the bone should be in relation to its length. Default = 0.155
   showLocalAxes? : boolean, //Flag to display te bones local axes as line systems. Default = False
   localAxesSize? : number, //Size of the local Axes. Default = 0.075
};
```

<Playground id="#BCU1XR#1616" title="New Viewer Example" description="Simple example of using the new viewer."/>

#### Debug Shader Usage

Sometimes you will need to actually see which parts of your mesh a certain bone is influencing. When this need arises we've got you covered with some nifty new ShaderMaterials!

##### SkeletonMap Shader

The first one, which is a color map of the entire skeleton, is called a SkeletonMap. This will show you a unique color for each bone and visual feedback of how all of their influences interact. It's static method and when creating one, it expects two parameters, options and scene.

```javascript
let mapShader = BABYLON.Debug.SkeletonViewer.CreateSkeletonMapShader(options, scene);
```

Inside the options you must pass a skeleton key and value. A secondary optional argument for generating the color gradient for the bones is called as colorMap.

```javascript
let options = {
   skeleton : BABYLON.Skeleton,
   colorMap? : any[]
};
```

In order to leverage the color map you will need to pass in an array of objects with this format:

```javascript
let colorMapItem = {
  color: BABYLON.Color3, //The Color to use
  location: number, // Where on the gradient it is. Between 0-1
};
```

This array is expected to have the items arranged with their location value in ascending order.
<Playground id="#BCU1XR#1618" title="Skeleteon Map Shader" description="Simple example of using the skeleton map shader."/>

##### BoneWeight Shader

The second of the two will show more specific data on a per bone basis.

```javascript
let boneWeightShader = BABYLON.Debug.SkeletonViewer.CreateBoneWeightShader(options, scene);
```

Inside the options you must pass a skeleton key and value. Optional arguments are for color control and the starting selected bone.

```javascript
let options = {
   skeleton : BABYLON.Skeleton,
   colorBase? : BABYLON.Color3, //The color when a bone has 0 influence. Default = Black
   colorZero? : BABYLON.Color3, //The color when a bone has > 0 influence < 0.25. Default = Blue
   colorQuarter? : BABYLON.Color3, //The color when a bone has >= 0.25 influence < 0.5. Default = Green
   colorHalf? : BABYLON.Color3, //The color when a bone has >= 0.5 influence < 0.75. Default = Yellow
   colorFull? : BABYLON.Color3, //The color when a bone has >= 0.75 influence <= 1. Default = Red
   targetBoneIndex?: number //The bone._index value that you wish to display. Default = 0
};
```

The bone that is to be displayed is controlled by setting a uniform on the shader.

```javascript
boneWeightShader.setFloat(targetBoneIndex, index);
```

## Sharing Skeletons Between Skinned Meshes

Multiple skinned meshes can reference the same skeleton, sometimes with different skinned mesh transforms. This is important for some scenarios, such as populating a crowd. Due to this, skeleton bone methods involving absolute transforms require the associated skinned mesh as an argument.

Here are two `Bone` methods that require the associated skinned mesh:

- `bone.getPosition` for world space
- `bone.getRotation` for world space

Failing to pass in the associated skinned mesh can potentially result in unexpected behavior since the math will not take the skinned mesh transform into account. This effectively computes transforms relative to the skeleton root instead of absolute transforms.

For example, consider this playground which loads the `dude` model with multiple skinned meshes pointing to one skeleton. _This is loading the same model as referenced from earlier in this page._

<Playground id="#92Y727" title="Loading Model" description="Loading a model with multiple skinned meshes."/>

In this case, all of the skinned meshes have the identity transform and any of these meshes passed to `Bone` methods will be equivalent, but this is not always the case.

Using the following code, the arms of the `dude` has been moved by `30` units on the `x` axis. A box has been placed with a matching transform of the bone to visually see the transform. Note that the associated skinned mesh is being passed to `getPosition` and `getRotation`.

```javascript
const mesh = scene.getMeshByName(" / 3");
mesh.position = new BABYLON.Vector3(30, 0, 0);

const box = BABYLON.MeshBuilder.CreateBox("box", { size: 3 }, scene);
const bone = scene.getBoneByName("bone30");
scene.onBeforeRenderObservable.add(() => {
  box.position.copyFrom(bone.getPosition(BABYLON.Space.WORLD, mesh));
  box.rotation.copyFrom(bone.getRotation(BABYLON.Space.WORLD, mesh));
});
```

<Playground id="#1TVBBI#1" title="Loading Model with Offset" description="Loading a model with multiple skinned meshes where one has an position offset."/>

This is what happens if the mesh is not passed in as an argument to the `get` methods.

```javascript
scene.onBeforeRenderObservable.add(() => {
  box.position.copyFrom(bone.getPosition(BABYLON.Space.WORLD));
  box.rotation.copyFrom(bone.getRotation(BABYLON.Space.WORLD));
});

The box is in the wrong place (i.e., the math does not take the skinned mesh position shift of `30` units into account). This is also what happens when showing the gizmos for the bone because the gizmo doesn't know which skinned mesh is associated with the bone either.

It is important to identify the associated skinned mesh and then pass it to the bone methods to get absolute transforms. Depending on the model, there may be multiple skinned meshes that correspond to the skeleton. Without knowing the specifics of a model, the best a generic algorithm can do is narrow the list of possible skinned meshes to the ones that reference the target skeleton. In this example, the code is filtering the loaded meshes by the ones matching the first skeleton.

```javascript
const skinnedMeshes = meshes.filter(function (mesh) {
  return mesh.skeleton === skeletons[0];
});
```

<Playground id="#1TVBBI#5" title="Loading Model, Filter Meshes by Skeleton" description="Loading a model with multiple skinned meshes and filtering the meshes to a list of skinned meshes that reference a skeleton."/>

One of these will be the correct mesh to pass to the bone to get absolute transforms. It is up to the user loading the model to decide which is the correct one.

Note that some engines (e.g., Unity3D) and glTF do not support sharing skeletons between skinned meshes with different transforms because the skinned mesh transforms are ignored in these cases. If nothing is modified after loading from a glTF, any of the filtered list of skinned meshes should work as the skinned mesh argument to a bone method for getting absolute transforms. In this case, selecting the first mesh of this filter works for glTF assets. See [this issue](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/issues/1285) and linked issues for more detailed analysis of shared skeletons in glTF and [glTF Skinning](/features/featuresDeepDive/importers/glTF/glTFSkinning) for more details about glTF skinning in Babylon.js.
