# Node Render Graph Blocks

The Node Render Graph system is based on a set of blocks representing different tasks and resources. Each block has its own set of inputs and outputs, allowing users to link them together to create complex interactions.

The preferred way to use the node framework is to use the [Node Render Graph Editor](https://nrge.babylonjs.com/) (NRGE), but you can also use it programmatically by creating instances of the different `NodeRenderGraphXXX` classes and connecting them with connection points.
