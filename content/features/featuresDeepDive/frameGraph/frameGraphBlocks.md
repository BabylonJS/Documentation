# Node Render Graph Blocks

The Node Render Graph system is built around a set of blocks that represent different tasks and resources. Each block has its own set of inputs and outputs, allowing users to connect them together to create complex interactions.

## General notes

### Block inputs and outputs

Each block has a set of inputs and outputs. Inputs are used to receive data from other blocks, while outputs are used to send data to other blocks. The inputs and outputs can be connected together to create a flow of data between the blocks.
