See the [Basic Concepts and Getting Started](/features/featuresDeepDive/frameGraph/frameGraphBasicConcepts) section for general information on nomenclature and an overview of the frame graph concept.

This section describes the frame graph class framework:
* [Overview of the frame graph framework](/features/featuresDeepDive/frameGraph/frameGraphClassFramework/frameGraphClassOverview) describes the main classes that are part of the framework
* [List of task classes in the frame graph framework](/features/featuresDeepDive/frameGraph/frameGraphClassFramework/frameGraphTaskList) describes all the tasks that can be used with a frame graph.
<br/>
Note that the implementation of the framework is inspired by Unity's [Render Graph System](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.2/Documentation/Manual/urp/render-graph-introduction.html).
