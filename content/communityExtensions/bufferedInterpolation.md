# Babylon Buffered Interpolation

Have you ever wanted to manage the position, rotation, and scale of networked Babylon.js objects? This [awesome package](https://github.com/virbela/buffered-interpolation) provides a fantastic solution. It is a port of Mozilla's [buffered-interpolation](https://github.com/InfiniteLee/buffered-interpolation) to Babylon.js and aims to work well both in situations with continuous and sparse network updates.

To see this system working live, check out the virtual co-presence experience: [Frame](https://framevr.io/).
