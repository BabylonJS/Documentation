## Welcome to the Babylon.JS Editor documentation

Welcome to the documentation of the Babylon.JS Editor. A series of tutorials are available to understand the basics of the Editor. It is recommanded to read the tutorials before starting with the Editor.

Please note that the editor is a community project maintained mostly by Julien Moreau-Mathis ([@luaacro](https://twitter.com/Luaacro)).

## Downloading

The Babylon.js Editor is available as a desktop application using Electron.
When an update is available (new features, bug fixes), you'll get notified and the editor will download the new installer for you.

The Editor supports Windows, macOS and Linux and can be downloaded through its website: http://editor.babylonjs.com/

- `Ctrl+f` or `Command+f`: find a node in the current scene or run a command
- `Ctrl+r` or `Command+r`: run the application/game in the integrated browser
- `Ctrl+b` or `Command+b`: build the project (using WebPack, this can take a while)
- `Ctrl+g` or `Command+g`: generate the project (generates all outputs of the current project (scripts, scene files, etc.))

### In preview

- `f`: focus the selected node
- `t`: enable/disable the positon gizmo
- `r`: enable/disable the rotation gizmo

- `i`: toggle the isolated mode. Isolated mode is used to help debugging a mesh by isolating it. Just select a mesh in the Editor and then type `i`. `escape` to exit isolation mode.
- `suppr.`: remove the selected node
- `Ctrl+c` or `Command+c`: copy the selected node
