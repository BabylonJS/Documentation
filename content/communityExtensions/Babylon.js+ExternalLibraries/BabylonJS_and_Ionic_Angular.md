## A brief example showing how to useBabylon.js in an Ionic 2 application

For anyone interested, it is possible to integrateBabylon.js in an Ionic/Cordova app in just a few easy steps. The following is just a narrative of how I did it, since it's been a trial and error thing probably there'll be a better way of doing it, when in doubt I've gone for simplicity rather than optimisation.

## What you need

First, you need node/npm installed. For more on that look [here](https://nodejs.org/en/).

Second, and quite obviously, a working Ionic environment. How to do this is very well documented by the Ionic people so, if you haven't done it before have a look [there](https://ionicframework.com/docs/intro/tutorial/).

## The process

1. Start a new Ionic project, I used the blank template, which provides a basic scaffolding, and removed all unnecessary stuff.

2. Then, installBabylon.js within the project:

```bash
npm install babylonjs@2.5.0 --save
```

> A couple things to remember:
>
> - Be careful not to write babylon (different package, yes it happened to me!).
> - Specify version, otherwise npm will install the preview branch and things will fall apart at runtime!

3. Go to the last line of babylon.d.ts (in node_modules/babylonjs/dist) and type:

```typescript
export = BABYLON;
```

> These last two steps will create the proper entry in the node_modules folder and will let you do:
>
> ```typescript
> import BABYLON from "babylonjs";
> ```
>
> wherever you need to.

4. Depending of what you intend to do in your app, other dependencies might be needed (e.g. cannon.js or hand.js)
   You could install them the same way asBabylon.js, but I just downloaded the javascript files, saved them in the www folder and referenced using script tags in `index.html`. However, this has a downside, the www folder is generated after transpiling, so you will need to add those javascript files **manually**.

5. After this I generated an Angular [Provider](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/providers), this is a singleton class that will wrap ourBabylon.js Engine:

```bash
ionic g providerBabylon.js
```

> Besides holding our Engine instance, being in a provider allows for different pages to access the same Engine, e.g. you define different scenes in different pages and use the same Engine provider for all.

6. Another provider (ConfigProvider) is created to handle all necessary configuration variables. In this case it just contains the dice colors and texture for both dice.

   > Actually, when you look at it, a Provider is a regular typescript class, nothing really special apart from the **@Injectable** decorator, which tells Angular that this is a special class to be injected during the bootstrap process to make it available to the hierarchy of components that make an app.

7. The very basic configuration interface is an Ionic page showing the available options. Note the header, a basic Ionic component that handles the back button automatically.  
   All the values are stored in the Config service, that makes them available to any page that declares a dependency to the Config provider.

8. The Home page will contain theBabylon.js canvas. An Ionic page is basically an Angular component with some sugar added, mainly in the form of a few helpful life cycle hooks.  
   The whole scene is created here, note that we are using the two providers that were previously generated.  
   The ViewChild decorator is needed in order to have access to the canvas element, think of it as an Angular equivalent of good old 'document.getElementById' method.

## A few notes on the code

The app itself is a very basic no frills dice roller, but there are a few things worth mentioning:

- We are using Ionic components to provide a basic user interface, with a header and a couple FAB buttons to access the configuration screen and roll the dice. See the methods handling the button events.
- The Home page code makes use of `ionViewDidLoad` and `ionViewWillEnter`, both are Ionic hooks to the page life cycle. The first fires only once, when the view loads, so it is ideal to initialize variables and generate the scene proper.  
  The second fires every time the view is going to become active, it checks for possible changes in the configuration and modifies the vertex data to point to the correct coordinates if necessary.
- Ionic, by default, caches the views. so anything included in the `ionViewDidLoad` hook will run only once, so the methods createScene() and animate() are called only once. Caching can be disabled, in that case this method will fire every time the view is loaded, and the scene will be generated as new.

## Conclusion

IntegratingBabylon.js in an Ionic application was easier than it seemed at first, once you get to know a couple of thing of how Ionic/Angular 2 works. In fact, doing the same in an Ionic 1 app was easy too, but overall everything looks cleaner, more streamlined in the latest version.  
However, despite the improvements introduced to Angular, the overhead of having both Ionic andBabylon.js together might make performance a bit sluggish. Maybe it's not the best way of implementing a pure 3d action packed game.  
On the other hand, with Ionic you get things, like a very simple way of handling the user interface, navigation and storage out of the box, not to mention that, through Cordova, it's easy to build apps for any mobile platform, so it might be the way to go for less demanding apps.

Finally, this is how the app looks running on an actual Android 6.0 device:
