## Introduction: Carlos

To start, Carlos (the 3D artist) spent a good amount of time talking to 
Diane (the Babylon developer) to make sure they were on the same page
regarding what features the art should have. Both were of the opinion that
the visuals should be directly dictated by the art as much as possible;
in other words, as much as possible, art decisions should be made by an
artist in art tools, not by a programmer in programming tools. Thus, 
they ultimately decided that following major components should be
controlled from within the art assets:

-   The look and behavior of the main watch asset itself.
-   The appearance of all configuration options.
-   The motion of the cameras, as much as possible.
    -   In non-interactive "matchmoving" states, the full motion of the
        camera should be specified in art.
    -   In the interactive "arc-rotate" state, key parameters for the
        camera such as starting position and focus point should be
        specified in art.
-   The location and visibility of "hotspots" -- elements of the 3D scene 
    that might be tagged/tracked by 2D UI (labels, etc.).
    -   The position of the hotspots would always be specified by art.
    -   In non-interactive "matchmoving" states, the visibility of the
        hotspots could be fully specified by art because of certainty 
        about the position of the camera.
    -   In the interactive "arc-rotate" state where the camera could move
        unpredictably, art would specify key parameters that could then
        be used by the interactive experience to decide whether a hotspot
        was visible or not.

That feature list also doubled as a pretty decent roadmap; so, with a plan
in place, Carlos got started by creating...

## The Main Watch Asset

Dev Stories are not implementation guides or tutorials, so the precise
details of how Carlos modeled the main watch asset are beyond the scope of
this narrative. Instead, this section will provide high-level perspective 
on the key decisions and implementation choices Carlos made while creating 
the main Vaporwear watch asset.

1.  **File size**: The design for the Vaporwear site dictates that a 3D
    rendering should be the first thing a user sees when the site starts 
    up. To make this happen, the 3D model used in that first rendering 
    must be *small*; otherwise it won't download quickly enough for the
    site to start in a timely manner. Consequently, file size (as the
    determining factor of download time) became a key concern for the main
    watch asset. This was the primary motivation for deciding that the 
    main asset (which was all that was needed for the initial rendering)
    and additional assets 
    ([configuration options](#configuration-options), 
    etc.) should be packaged as separate files which could be downloaded 
    at different times. That way, larger assets (sophisticated materials, 
    etc.) could be included in the secondary files while still allowing
    the main asset file to remain as small as possible.
    
    ![File size](/img/devStories/vaporwearConfigurator/chapter_art/01_file_size.png)
1.  **Animations**: In different parts of the site, the watch was supposed
    to adopt two different poses: wrapped "up" as though on a wrist and 
    laid "down" flat as though on a table. To transition between them, the 
    watch would need to animate. While he could have used any animation 
    mechanism supported by glTF (the file format he'd agreed on with 
    Diane), he chose to simply rig the watch and give it two animations: 
    one to go "up" and one to go "down." He even added a little spin to the 
    animation, just for style.
    
    ![Blender NLA](/img/devStories/vaporwearConfigurator/chapter_art/02_nla.png)
1.  **Materials**: While a key goal of main asset was to stay small by 
    leaving most of the materials to be downloaded later in another file,
    the main asset still needed to include the minimum number of materials
    it needed to render. Carlos took special care to make sure the 
    materials included with the main asset were as small as possible while
    still looking good.
    
    ![Main material](/img/devStories/vaporwearConfigurator/chapter_art/03_main_material.png)
1.  **Watch Face**: The face of the watch was supposed to be dynamic,
    showing the actual time, and Diane had told the team she would take
    care of that in code using Babylon's GUI textures. Carlos still needed
    to provide a material for the watch face, but texture within it 
    (specifically the emissive texture) would simply be replaced, he knew,
    by the GUI texture Diane would generate at runtime. Thus, he could 
    make the provided watch face texture as small and useless as he wanted
    to since it would never be seen in the rendering anyway.
    
    ![Watch face texture](/img/devStories/vaporwearConfigurator/chapter_art/04_face_texture.png)

While working on the main asset, Carlos periodically wanted to check that
the asset would render the way he expected it to in the final experience.
(The various previews available in Blender, his tool of choice, often
rendered things differently than a 
[3D Commerce-certified](https://www.khronos.org/3dcommerce/) renderer would.) 
The best way he found to see how the model would *actually* render was to 
export it to a GLB, then drag-and-drop that GLB (along with his intended 
[IBL lighting](https://doc.babylonjs.com/guidedLearning/createAGame/extraFeatures#ibl-image-based-lighting)) 
into Babylon's 
[3D Commerce-certified version of the Sandbox](https://3dcommerce.babylonjs.com/).
Not only would this render the model in a standard way, but it would 
actually render it *using Babylon.js*, meaning that the code rendering the
model in that Sandbox would be the same code rendering the model in the
real experience on the Vaporwear site. Thus, by viewing his model using 
that Sandbox, he could be sure he was seeing the model (animations and all) 
the same way that customers eventually would.

![Watch in sandbox](/img/devStories/vaporwearConfigurator/chapter_art/05_watch_in_sandbox.png)

Note that the main asset's visuals weren't the only things that would be
included in the main asset file; small amounts of data for 
[camera motion](#camera-motion)
and 
[hotspots](#hotspots) 
would also need to be included, as will be discussed later. However,
Carlos didn't want to tackle those features until he'd finished with the
visuals, so once he had the main asset built he moved on to creating the 
configuration options.

## Configuration Options

The configuration options for the Vaporwear smartwatch were essentially
all the ways customers could customize it, so Carlos had to work closely
with Allan from Vaporwear to make sure all the options were representable 
and looked correct. The available options were as follows:

1.  Users could choose from several types of watch bands.
1.  Users could choose from several tints/finishes for the watch face.
1.  Users could choose to add four gemstone "studs" to the watch.
1.  If the users had added studs, they could choose from several colors of
    gemstones.
1.  If the users had added studs, they could chose from several different
    metals for the bezels.

From an art perspective, these options boiled down to two underlying 
operations:

1.  Adding separate geometry to the scene (if users chose to add studs).
1.  Swapping the materials on geometry within the scene.

Allan also told Carlos that Vaporwear might add new stud configurations
later, or new kinds of bands, etc., and that he should design his
approach to the art with that in mind. For this reason, Carlos decided
to have the additional "stud" geometry in its own file, then have another
file essentially full of nothing but materials; that way, more 
additive geometry or additional materials files could be added later on
by just continuing the pattern established while making the first batch of
assets.

### "Studs" Additive Geometry

Creating the "studs" asset was quite straightforward, with only a few
noteworthy "tricks."

1.  **Animation**: The "studs" asset would be imported separately from the 
    main asset, but visually it needed to be *attached* to the main asset, 
    including while animating. In order to make this work (without Diane 
    having to change a bunch of offsets in code later, which would involve 
    making art decisions), all Carlos needed to do was model the studs in 
    the correct position relative to the watch's position *when no 
    animation was applied*. Because Carlos had initially modeled the watch 
    flat, then rigged it and animated it from there, this meant he needed 
    to model the studs in the right position relative to the watch when it 
    was flat. As long as he got that offset right, all Diane would have to 
    do later would be to attach the studs to the correct bone of the 
    watch's skeleton, and the studs should correctly position themselves 
    and animate as the watch's skeleton animates.
    
    ![Watch laying flat](/img/devStories/vaporwearConfigurator/chapter_art/06_watch_flat.png)
1.  **Instancing**: The four "studs" were identical, and this provided an 
    opportunity for Carlos to give a little boost to the eventual rendering 
    performance of the asset. 
    [Instancing](https://doc.babylonjs.com/divingDeeper/mesh/copies/instances)
    is a technique that allows renderers to render multiple copies of 
    identical meshes very efficiently, and from Blender it's easy to 
    specify instancing by simply 
    [creating a linked object](https://doc.babylonjs.com/divingDeeper/mesh/copies/instances#blender),
    so Carlos did that with the studs in order to help them render more
    efficiently.
    
    ![Studs as linked meshes](/img/devStories/vaporwearConfigurator/chapter_art/07_studs_linked.png)
1.  **Materials**: As with the main asset, the "studs" asset was created
    to contain specific geometry, not a materials collection, so Carlos
    included in it only one of each kind of material it used -- one 
    gemstone material, one bezel material -- to serve as the default
    materials for the geometry. Additional materials would be used for
    material-swap configuration, and so they would be included alongside
    other additional materials in a dedicated additional materials file.

Again, the best way for Carlos to know for sure how his model would 
render was to export to GLB and view it in Babylon 3D 
Commerce-certified Sandbox. He was even able to use the 
[Inspector](https://doc.babylonjs.com/toolsAndResources/tools/inspector)
to modify the gemstone material as a preview of what it would look like 
with another material.

![Studs material modification](/img/devStories/vaporwearConfigurator/chapter_art/08_studs_in_sandbox_modified.png)

### Additional Materials File

The materials are, very often, the most important factor in determining
how a rendered model looks; they are also, very often, by far the
largest piece of the file size of a 3D asset. Several of the materials
Vaporwear wanted as configuration options, particularly for the watch
band, were very high-quality and consequently very large. Because these
materials were bundled into a separate file just for materials, they
thankfully wouldn't delay the experience as they could be downloaded 
asynchronously in the background. Even so, Carlos remained mindful of
the file size and used what tricks he could to minimize the megabytes
without sacrificing visual quality.

1.  **Geometry**: The easiest step to keep the file size small was to make
    sure that the geometry in the materials file was minimal. Geometry
    wasn't the point of that file -- the only reason it had geometry was
    so that the materials could go on something -- so Carlos kept the 
    geometry to minimalistic single-quad planes. This didn't have *much*
    impact on the file size as geometry in general tends to be far, far
    smaller than textures, but it was still better to not waste space.
    
    ![Materials quads](/img/devStories/vaporwearConfigurator/chapter_art/09_material_quads.png)
1.  **PBR parameters**: A much more impactful measure was to exclude
    certain textures when those textures could effectively be replaced
    by set parameters. For example, some of the materials Vaporwear
    wanted for their watch bands originally came with PBR textures that
    were effectively all one solid color. Carlos was able to exclude 
    textures like these entirely by just setting his material to use a
    constant value instead of the texture. He double-checked with 
    Vaporwear that doing this didn't impact the rendering negatively,
    but in every case they were unable to discern a difference.
    
    ![Omitted textures](/img/devStories/vaporwearConfigurator/chapter_art/10_omitted_textures.png)
1.  **Texture resolution**: The last and most powerful trick Carlos used
    to manage file size was to change the resolution of the PBR textures. 
    He had to be careful about doing this because this very easily *could*
    degrade the quality of the visuals by losing fine details. However,
    many of the materials were never expected to be viewed from
    very close, and ultimately Carlos was able to reduce the resolution
    of every material texture by at least *some* amount.
    
    ![Larger and smaller textures](/img/devStories/vaporwearConfigurator/chapter_art/11_big_next_to_small.png)
1.  (**Addendum:** Another trick that can also be worth trying is using
    JPEGs instead of PNGs for the texture files. This is a trick that
    must be used cautiously as JPEG compression can sometimes degrade the
    quality of the texture in problematic ways; but when it works, 
    especially on larger textures, it can provide significant size 
    advantages. This is mentioned as an addendum because Carlos probably
    *should* have tried it alongside his other optimization techniques,
    but he didn't because, as it happened, he simply didn't think of it.)

Even with all these tricks, the additional materials file ended up 
weighing in at a whopping 15 megabytes, *far* too large to load in the 
foreground of a Web experience, but acceptable for loading in the 
background. As before, Carlos double-checked how the materials would render 
using Babylon's 3D Commerce-certified Sandbox. With the materials 
finished, he'd now completed all of the art work that could be looked at; 
next he needed to decide *how* the art should be looked at.

## Camera Motion

The new Vaporwear experience needed two types of camera motion: 
non-interactive "matchmoving" camera motion comparable to a camera "on
rails"; and interactive "arc-rotate" camera motion which would allow the
user to look at the model from different angles at will. Though these two
types of motion required different parameters, both were relatively easy
for Carlos to set up in Blender.

1.  To create the "matchmoving" camera motion, all Carlos had to do was
    add an empty transform (sometimes called a "null") to his scene and 
    create an animation that moved it in the way he wanted the camera to 
    move. He even found that he could attach a Blender camera to the moving 
    node, allowing him to see the motion directly, and that camera would be 
    exported to glTF simply as the empty transform he needed. The Vaporwear 
    experience contained four different states with "matchmoving" camera 
    motion, so Carlos ended up with four named empty transforms, each with 
    an animation that moved it.

    ![Matchmove nulls](/img/devStories/vaporwearConfigurator/chapter_art/12_matchmove_nulls.png)
1.  Creating the parameters for the "arc-rotate" camera state was not as 
    precise -- the camera in that state was interactive, so its motion
    could not be fully specified by art -- so all Carlos had to decide
    was the starting position for the camera and its center of focus. For
    the latter, he created another named empty transform to mark the point
    around which he wanted the camera to orbit; and as for the starting 
    position he actually wanted it to be the same as the starting position
    for one of the "matchmoving" camera motions, so the same empty 
    transform that provided the position for that "matchmoving" state 
    also served to specify the starting position for the "arc-rotate" 
    state.

    ![Camera overall](/img/devStories/vaporwearConfigurator/chapter_art/13_camera_overall.png)

An important note is that these camera motions were exported as part of the
main asset GLB, not additional geometry or materials GLBs. This was 
necessary because, in the experience design, the camera starts moving as 
soon as the watch is visible, so the camera movement animations needed to 
be available as part of the main asset. Thankfully, this kind of data is
small in file size, so adding the camera motion empty transforms and 
animations to the main asset was not a problem.

## Hotspots

*Hotspots* are points of interest in the 3D scene that can be tracked
so that 2D UI (markers, labels, etc.) can be connected to specific 
locations in the 3D scene.

![Hotspot](/img/devStories/vaporwearConfigurator/chapter_art/14_hotspot.png)

The design for the Vaporwear site featured three hotspots, two of which
would be visible during a "matchmoving" state and one of which would
be visible during the "arc-rotate" state. Doing the actual tracking
that would turn these 3D points of interest into 2D hotspots was for 
Diane to do in Babylon code; all Carlos had to do was specify where these
hotspots were and when they should be visible.

1.  Specifying location for the hotspots was easy: for each of the three,
    Carlos simply created a named empty transform to mark the point of 
    interest.
    
    ![Hotspot nulls](/img/devStories/vaporwearConfigurator/chapter_art/15_hotspot_nulls.png)
1.  Specifying visibility for the hotspots in the "matchmoving" state
    was also simple. Because the motion of the camera was fully determined
    by an animation in these states, Carlos could also characterize when
    each hotspot would be visible using an animation. Under each hotspot,
    he added another named empty transform, then created an animation to
    move that transform along the X axis to indicate visibility. If the
    empty transform's local position's X value was 0, then the hotspot was
    not supposed to be visible; and if the X value was 1, then the hotspot
    was supposed to be visible. Thus, as long as the hotspot animation
    was synchronized with the camera movement animation, Diane would 
    simply have to check the visibility indicator's local position to
    determine whether the hotspot was visible or not.
    
    ![Hotspot visibility](/img/devStories/vaporwearConfigurator/chapter_art/16_hotspot_visibility.png)
1.  Specifying visibility for the hotspot in the "arc-rotate" state had to
    be done differently because the camera's motion in that state would be
    driven by the user, not by an animation. Carlos and Diane considered
    several different ways to characterize visibility, and what they 
    ultimately decided on was to use a thresholded dot product to describe
    a "cone" within which the hotspot would be visible: if the dot product
    between the direction from the hotspot to the camera and the null's
    X axis was below a certain threshold, the hotspot would be considered
    invisible. Once again, Carlos added a named empty transform parented
    to the hotspot itself and used the local X position of that transform
    to specify the dot product threshold.
    
    ![Arc-rotate hotspot](/img/devStories/vaporwearConfigurator/chapter_art/17_arc-rotate_hotspot.png)

As with the camera motions, these hotspot parameters were added to the 
main asset file: they were very small and could be needed very early in
the experience. With the addition of these hotspots, Carlos now had all
the art features needed for the Vaporwear experience; and after checking
one last time in Babylon's 3D Commerce-certified Sandbox that all three
GLBs included everything they should have (and only what they should have)
and rendered the way he wanted, Carlos passed the GLBs along to Diane
to be incorporated into 
[the 3D part of the new Vaporwear site](./3d).
