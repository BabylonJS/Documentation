# From One to Many

A nice big step now as we take the simple box and turn it into a house, or two. As houses do not float we will create some ground and then see how we can position, rotate and re-size the house and set it on the ground. Since a blank box looks just like a blank box we will add texture to give it the appearance of having windows and doors. To keep the rain out let's add a roof mesh and merge the two meshes together. Of course a couple of houses do not make a village so we will see how we can copy a mesh as many times as we wish. Since builders are noisy workers we will show how you can include sounds but then silence them immediately as anything but the sounds you want to work with are distracting.
