### Optimizations

-   Added an engine creation option to compile all shaders with medium precision ([Deltakosh](https://github.com/deltakosh))
-   Optimized effect reused for shadow maps ([Deltakosh](https://github.com/deltakosh))
-   Added support for scissor testing ([Deltakosh](https://github.com/deltakosh))
-   Improved shader precision detection ([Deltakosh](https://github.com/deltakosh))
-   Added support for bone matrix texture, allowing skeletons to use a texture instead of uniforms when possible ([Deltakosh](https://github.com/deltakosh))
-   Refactored of the SolidParticleSystem code for performance and code quality improvement ([barroij](https://github.com/barroij))
-   Added per solid particle culling possibility: `solidParticle.isInFrustum()` ([jerome](https://github.com/jbousquie))
-   Performance-oriented changes ([barroij](https://github.com/barroij)):
    -   Prevented avoidable matrix inversion or square root computation.
    -   Enabled constant-time removal from the `transformNodes` array and `materials` array of the `Scene`. As a consequence, the order of the element within these arrays might change during a removal.
    -   Enabled constant-time removal from the `instances` array of a `Mesh`. As a consequence, the order of the element within this array might change during a removal.
    -   Stopped calling `Array.splice` on the `scene.meshes` array and on the `engine._uniformBuffer` when removing an element. As a consequence, the order of the element within these arrays might change during a removal.
    -   Added an option `useGeometryUniqueIdsMap` in the `Scene` constructor options. When set to true, each `Scene` isntance will have and will keep up-to-date a map of geometry per `uniqueId`. This is to avoid browsing all the geometries of the scene when a new one is being pushed. It also enables a removal of geometry in constant time. Disabled by default.
    -   Added an option `useMaterialMeshMap` in the `Scene` constructor options. When set to true, each `Material` isntance will have and will keep up-to-date a map of its bound meshes. This is to avoid browsing all the meshes of the scene to retrieve the ones bound to the current material when disposing the Material. Disabled by default.
    -   Added an option `useClonedMeshhMap` in the `Scene` constructor options. When set to true, each `Mesh` will have and will keep up-to-date a map of cloned meshes. This is to avoid browsing all the meshes of the scene to retrieve the ones that have the current mesh as source mesh. Disabled by default.
    -   Added `blockfreeActiveMeshesAndRenderingGroups` property in the `Scene`, following the same model as `blockMaterialDirtyMechanism`. This is to avoid calling `Scene.freeActiveMeshes` and `Scene.freeRenderingGroups` for each disposed mesh when we dispose several meshes in a row. Enable by setting `blockfreeActiveMeshesAndRenderingGroups` to `true` just before disposing the meshes, then set it back to `false` just after.
    -   Prevented code from doing useless and possible time consuming computation when disposing the `ShaderMaterial` of a `LinesMesh`.
    -   Make a better use of the `isIdentity` cached value within a `Matrix`.
    -   Make sure we browse all the submeshes only once in `Material.markAsDirty` function.
    -   Added an `Vector3.UnprojectRayToRef` static function to avoid computing and inverting the projection matrix twice when updating a Ray.
-   Added per mesh culling strategy ([jerome](https://github.com/jbousquie))
